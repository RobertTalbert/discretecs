    "# Lesson 7: Solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary:__ In the previous lesson we learned a little more about recurrence relations and what it means to _solve_ a recurrence relation. We also saw how to take a _closed formula_ and check to see if it is a solution to a recurrence relation. What we have not discussed yet is how to find closed-formula solutions in the first place. This turns out to be a very hard problem, but in some special cases -- in particular, the case of _first- and second-order linear homogeneous_ recurrence relations, we can use high school algebra to find solutions. That's the main focus of this lesson. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson addresses the following learning target(s):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ __RI.4:__ I can solve a first- or second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of your background for this lesson will come from three videos posted below. Here is the takeaway: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Solving recurrence relations in general is an interesting and hard mathematical problem. But when the recurrence relation is __first- or second-order, linear,__ and __homogeneous__, there's a method using basic high school algebra that will yield a solution. \n",
    "+ Remember that _order_ refers to the number of steps we have to go back in the recurrence relation. For example $a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}$ is second-order, and $b_n = b_{n-3}$ is third-order. \n",
    "+ _Linear_ means that the only operations being performed on the sequence elements in the recurrence relation is multiplication by a constant (a fixed number). For example $a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}$ is linear, while $a_n = n^2a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}$ is not. \n",
    "+ _Homogeneous_ means that every term in the recurrence relation has a term of the sequence attached to it. For example $a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}$ is homogeneous but $a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2} + 5$ is not. \n",
    "+ First- and second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relations have a technique for solution that involves finding the __characteristic equation__ for the recurrence relation, solving it to get the __characteristic roots__, and then using the __initial conditions__ and high school algebra to find a closed-formula solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "The details are in the videos. \n",
    "\n",
    "This first video (running time 2:09) explains more about the terminology and how to know when a recurrence relation is first- or second order linear and homogeneous. (Direct link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c6Bg2GJvQw) "
