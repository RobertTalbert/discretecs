    "# Lesson 15: Representation of graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary:__ In the last lesson we introduced the concept of the graph and related ideas and terminology. In this lesson we will discuss different ways to _represent_ graphs and how to make and manipulate them in Sage. We will focus on representing graphs as _lists of pairs_, as _Python dictionaries_, and as _adjacency matrices_ just as we did with directed graphs. And we'll look at a few Sage methods for working with graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson addresses the following learning targets: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __GT.2:__ I can represent a directed or undirected graph as a list of tuples, an adjacency matrix, a directed graph, or a Python dictionary and convert from one representation to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note:__ To get the most out of this set of notes, please download the Jupyter notebook (either from nbviewer or from the Lessons and Learning Targets card) and open it in SageMath Cloud using the SageMath kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Last time we introduced the concept of the _(undirected) graph_ and defined like this: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Definition:__ A __graph__ $G$ consists of two sets: A finite, nonempty set $V$ of objects called __nodes__ or __vertices__; and a set $E$ of 2-element subsets of $V$ called __edges__. These two sets are called the _vertex set_ and _edge set_ of the graph, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is abstract, meaning that it does not depend on any particular way of representing a graph visually or as a data structure. Abstraction gives us choice in how we choose to represent graphs. We've seen that we can represent a graph as a visual diagram of points (nodes) and line segments (edges). In this lesson we will look at three other representations, focusing on how Sage represents and works with graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing graphs as lists of tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental way that Sage represents graphs is as __lists of pairs__. This is also how Sage represents _directed_ graphs. For example, here is a very simple graph on four nodes numbered 0 through 3. Study the syntax to see how Sage does it. Then execute the code cell to see the result. "

    "The basic process is: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write the graph as a list (not a set) of pairs, with each pair representing an edge. \n",
    "2. Create the graph using the `Graph` command, and plug in the list of edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is actually created once you execute the `Graph` command. To see it, use the `.show()` method just like you did with directed graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder how Sage knows to create undirected edges instead of directed edges, since the syntax for creating the graph is exactly the same as for directed graphs. The answer is in the `Graph` constructor. Using `Graph` tells Sage to create an undirected graph. If we wanted a directed graph using the same information, we would have used `DiGraph` instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "Go back to that code block above and play with it to answer the following questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Notice that the last edge was given \"out of order\", `(3,2)` instead of `(2,3)`. What happens if you replace `(3,2)` with `(2,3)`? Do you get a different looking graph, an error message, or what?\n",
    "2. Since we have an edge `(0,1)`, do we also need to add an edge `(1,0)` to indicate that the direction is two-directional? What happens if you add in `(1,0)` to the edge list above and try to construct the graph? \n",
    "3. Suppose we wanted to add a node \"4\" to this graph that is _isolated_, that is, there is no edge with 4? How would you change the list of pairs? Is it even possible? \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up: We can represent a graph in Sage (and outside of Sage, if we wanted to write it on paper) as a list of tuples, each tuple representing an edge of the graph. This is similar to the definition in which the graph is defined in terms of a set of nodes and a set of two-element subsets of the vertex set. "
