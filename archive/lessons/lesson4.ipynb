    "# Lesson 4: Structural induction\n",

    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary:__ In this lesson we will introduce one more variation on the theme of induction. For MTH 325 this might be the most important one of all: _structural induction_. This is almost exactly what it sounds like -- a method of induction used to prove things about _structures_ like sets, and later on we will use this with relations, graphs, and trees. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson addresses the following learning target(s): \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __RI.2:__ I can outline and analyze a mathematical proof using mathematical induction over the positive integers, weak induction, strong induction, and structural induction.\n",
    "+ __RI.3:__ I can construct a correct proof using mathematical induction over the positive integers, weak induction, strong induction, or structural induction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses particularly on structural induction. \"Weak induction\" is the usual induction process we have already discussed (see Lesson 2), and \"strong induction\" was discussed in Lesson 3. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen two different \"flavor\" of induction -- _weak_ induction (which is what you learned in MTH 225) and _strong_ induction. Both forms of induction involve more or less the same philosophy: you first prove that a statement is true in a single simple case; then assume that the statement is true at a certain _level_; then from that assumption prove the next level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outlines of each of these forms of induction can be summarized in this table. Here, suppose we are trying to prove the predicate $P(n)$ which is defined over the natural numbers (or positive integers, or all positive integers greater than a certain number): \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|        | Weak Induction                 | Strong Induction                |\n",
    "|:-------|:-------------------------------|:---------------------------------|\n",
    "|Base case | Prove that $P(0)$ is true  | Prove that $P(0)$ is true |\n",
    "|Induction hypothesis | Assume that $P(k)$ is true for some integer $k$ | Assume $P(0), P(1), P(2), \\dots P(k)$ are all true | \n",
    "| Inductive step | Prove $P(k+1)$ is true | Prove $P(k+1)$ is true |\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ If $P(n)$ is only claimed to be true for positive integers greater than or equal to some number, replace $0$ with that number. For example if $P(n)$ is claimed to be true only for $n \\geq 4$ then where it says $P(0)$ we use $P(4)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, both weak and strong induction have common threads. One thread you may not instantly see is that _weak and strong induction are only usable on propositions about integers_. Take a look at some of the propositions we saw in Lesson 3: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Every positive integer $n$ can be represented as a sum of distinct (different) powers of $2$.\n",
    "+ Suppose that $a_n$ is the sequence defined recursively by $a_1 = 1$, $a_2=8$, and $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$ for all $n \\geq 3$. Prove that for all positive integers $n$, $a_n = 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1} + 2(-1)^n$. \n",
    "+ For all natural numbers $n$, $12$ divides $n^4 - n^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all statements about _integers_. But there are other situations where we want to know something about not an integer but a _structure_ that is defined recursively -- a structure like a set, or later on in the course a relation, graph, or tree. Weak and strong induction aren't suited for those data types, so we are going to invent something that is. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example similar to ones we've seen before: \n",
    "\n",
    ">Let $S$ be the set defined as follows. First, define $2 \\in S$. Then, if $x \\in S$ then define $x + 2 \\in S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What's in this set? Well, $2$ is, because \"I said so\" -- it's explicitly stated in the definition of $S$. The recursive rule then says if a number is in $S$ then that number plus 2 is in $S$, so this means that $4$ is in $S$. And now since $4$ is in $S$, so is $6$. And then so is $8$. _And so on._\n",
    "\n",
    "It wouldn't be a great stretch of imagination to make the following claim: \n",
    "\n",
    ">Proposition: $S$ is the set of all positive even integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "However just because we think we see a pattern forming, is not sufficient to be a convincing proof. That phrase _and so on_ is dangerous! If I want to really _prove_ this proposition I cannot expect my reader to merge brains with me. I need to provide a proof. \n",
    "\n",
    "A proof by induction seems appropriate here because of the recursion involved in defining the set. But this is a _set_ and although the set seems to consist of positive integers, the proposition is not really _about_ integers -- it's about a _structure that contains them_. So this is not territory for weak or strong induction to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we still need a proof, so let's think about how this would work. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ First of all note that we are claiming that two sets are equal to each other: $S$, and the set of all positive even integers. For convenience let's call the second set $T$. So, $S$ is a recursively defined set and $T = \\{2, 4, 6, 8, \\dots\\}$. \n",
    "+ To show that $S = T$ as sets, we need to show two things: (1) That $S \\subseteq T$ and (2) that $T \\subseteq S$. This \"double subset inclusion argument\" is the standard way we prove that two sets are equal to each other. So the proof is going to have two parts. \n",
    "+ To prove that $S \\subseteq T$, we need to show that every element constructed recursively in $S$ is even, is positive, and is an integer.\n",
    "+ To prove that $T \\subseteq S$, we need to show that every even positive integer belongs to $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to outline this. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're actually going to prove that $T \\subseteq S$ first because this uses weak induction, which we already know. Let $P(n)$ be the statement that $2n$ (which is what an even positive integer looks like) belongs to $S$. We are claiming in this part that $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \\geq 1$. This is weak induction since it's just a claim about integers. So let's go through the process: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Base case:__ We want to show that $P(1)$ is true. Well, $P(1)$ is the claim that $2 \\in S$. And this is true because it says so in the definition of $S$. \n",
    "+ __Induction hypothesis:__ Assume that $P(k)$ is true for some integer $k > 1$. That is, assume that $2k \\in S$ for some $k > 1$. \n",
    "+ __Inductive step:__ We now want to prove that $P(k+1)$ is true, that is, prove that $2(k+1)$ (note the parentheses!!!) is in $S$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inductive step is actually very easy. Consider $2(k+1)$. This equals $2k+2$. By the induction hypothesis we now that $2k \\in S$. And according to the recursive definition of $S$, if $x$ is _any_ element of $S$ then so is $x + 2$. Well, here we have $2k \\in S$ and so by definition $2k+2 \\in S$. That ends this part of the proof. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to prove that that $S \\subseteq T$. To do this, take a randomly selected element out of $S$ and call it, say, $a$. We need to show that $a$ is an even positive integer -- that's three things. The only thing we know about $x$ is that it is the result of some level of recursion in the construction process. To prove this part we are going to mimic weak/strong induction -- again, _because $S$ is recursively defined and recursion-based propositions are proven almost always by induction_. \n",
    "\n",
    "What would be the \"base case\" here? We would want to show that the \"simplest element\" of $S$ belongs to $T$. The simplest case is the \"basis step\" of the recursive definition, which is $2$. Well, $2$ obviously belongs to $T$ because $2$ is an even positive integer. So just like usual, the base case is easy and done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now what would the \"inductive hypothesis\" be? We would assume that we have some previously-constructed element, which we'll call $a$, belonging to $S$ and that this element belongs to $T$ (the set of even positive integers). We would want to show that _all objects constructed using $a$ also belong to $T$._ \n",
    "\n",
    "__Pause:__ That inductive hypothesis is similar to what we assume for weak and strong induction -- assume that some \"prior case\" makes the statement true -- but with an important difference, namely that there's no \"ordering\" to these objects. We are not assuming $P(k)$ is true and then proving $P(k+1)$ is true, \"in order\". We are assuming that _a previously constructed part of the structure_ makes the proposition true, then proving that _all things built from that part make the statement true_. Think on that for a moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now back to the proof: \n",
    "\n",
    "We have assumed that we have an element $a \\in S$ and that this belongs to $T$. We want to show that all objects that can be built from $a$ also belong to $T$. Well, the only object we can build from $a$ is the number $a + 2$ according to the recursion rules. Is this object an even positive integer? Recalling that $a \\in T$ by assumption, \n",
    "\n",
    "+ $a$ is an integer, so $a+2$ is an integer as well because of the closure of the integers under addition. \n",
    "+ $a$ is positive, so $a + 2$ is also positive. \n",
    "+ $a$ is even, so $a+2$ is even because the sum of two even integers is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "That makes $a+2 \\in T$ which is what we needed to show. We've shown that given a random element in $S$, if we assume it's also in $T$ then everything built from it belongs to $T$. Since $S$ is nonempty (that's the base case) this means that _every_ element of $S$ is in $T$ , so $S \\subset T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have proven now that $S \\subseteq T$ and $T \\subseteq S$, we have proven $S = T$. $\\square$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to the second part of the proof, let's recap. What we used in the first part is a technique called __structural induction__. This is a form of induction that is used when we are proving results not about positive integers but about _recursively defined structures_ such as sets, relations, graphs, trees, and the like. The steps are: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Base case: Show that the result to be proven holds for all elements specified in the basis step of the recursive definition. \n",
    "+ Induction hypothesis: Assume that the result holds for arbitrarily selected instances of the structure. \n",
    "+ Inductive step: Prove that if a new instance of the structure can be built from the instances we declared in the induction hypothesis, then the result also holds for the new instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's like we want to show that the entire structure is \"infected\" by the property we are trying to prove based on the assumption that individual pieces are infected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's update the table from the top of the notes: \n",

    "One more example: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a function `len` that accepts a string of characters over some \"alphabet\" and the output is the length of that string. For example `len(\"askdasj\") = 7`. This function `len` actually exists in Python and works for abritrary lists. It is defined recursively as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Basis: `len` of the empty string is defined to be 0. \n",
    "+ Recursion: If `w` is any single character and $x$ is a string of characters, then `len(x+w) = len(x) + 1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the `+` means two different things in the equation in the recursive part: On the left side, it means concatenation of strings. For example `hello + world = helloworld`. On the right side it means addition of integers. So for example `len(grandvalley)` would be defined to be `1 + len(randvalley)`. And the recursion would continue from there until we reach the basis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a proposition that we would hope is true: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proposition:__ For any strings $x$ and $y$, `len(x+y) = len(x) + len(y)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again note that `+` means string concatenation on the left and integer addition on the right. So the proposition is saying that the length of two string concatenated together is the sum of the individual lengths of those strings. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proof:__ We will use structural induction. For the base case, we need to show that the result is true for all elements specified in the basis step of the definition. That is in this case, we need to show that if $x$ is the empty string and $y$ is any string, that `len(x+y) = len(x) + len(y)`. On the left side, note that `x+y = y` since `x` is empty. On the right side we have by definition that `len(x) = 0` (again since `x` is empty) and so the right side is `len(y)`. So we see that the left and right sides of the equation are equal, hence the base case is true. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Now assume that the result holds for some arbitrary string `z`. That is, we assume that `len(y+z) = len(y) + len(z)` whenever `y` is a string. \n",
    "\n",
    ">What we want to _show_ is that if we have another string that is built out of `z`, then the result holds for that new string. The way we \"build\" a  new string from `z` is to concatenate `z` with a single character. Call that character `a`. So suppose that `z+a` is a string built from `z`. What we want to show is that if we have yet another string `v` (which is not necessarily a single character) then `len(v+z+a) = len(v) + len(z+a)`. \n",
    "\n",
    ">To show this, note that by the recursive part of the definition, we have `len(v+z+a) = len(v+z) + 1` because `a` is just a single character. So the left side of the equation is `len(v+z) + 1`. What about the right side? Well, note that by the same definition, `len(z+a) = len(z) + 1` so the right side is `len(v) + len(z) + 1`. But by the induction hypothesis, we can say `len(v) + len(z) = len(v + z)`. So the right side becomes `len(v+z) + 1`. Now the left and right sides are equal, which concludes the inductive step and the entire proof. $\\square$. \n",
