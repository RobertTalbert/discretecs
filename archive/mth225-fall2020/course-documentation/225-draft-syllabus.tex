\hypertarget{start-here}{%
\subsection{START HERE}\label{start-here}}

Welcome to MTH 225: Discrete Structures 1! I'm Robert Talbert, a
professor in the Mathematics Department, and I am grateful that you are
signed up for the course and am looking forward to working with you this
semester.

Before reading any further, here are some first things to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{My highest priority this semester is your success in this
  course.} I am committed to helping you be successful in MTH 225 this
  semester. ``Success'' in the course is more than just good grades. It
  means that you are being \textbf{challenged} to grow as a learner,
  that you are \textbf{engaging actively} with tasks that feed your
  growth, and that you are creating \textbf{excellent work} in
  mathematics by completing challenging Discrete Structures-related
  tasks with a appropriate level of support. It also means that you are
  \textbf{building your lifelong learning skills} so that once the
  course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can
  continue to \textbf{learn new things independently}, and especially go
  on to \textbf{success in courses that have MTH 225 as a prerequisite}.
\item
  \textbf{College level mathematics is more than just computation.} On
  the pathway to ``success'' as outlined above, you will be asked to do
  more than just perform computations. You will be working on
  \textbf{explaining the meaning} of mathematical processes and results
  in oral and written forms to different audiences; \textbf{working on
  realistic applications} of basic skills to authentic problems;
  \textbf{extending basic ideas} to more advanced concepts; and
  \textbf{seeking true understanding} of underlying concepts. In fact,
  many of the computations you might do with algebra in high school
  level mathematics will be automated through computers in MTH 225, and
  your work will mostly focus on these higher-level tasks.
\item
  \textbf{You can expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this
  course.} None of these elements of ``success'' come easily. They
  require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the
  concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your
  comfort zones on a regular basis. You may find that you need to rewire
  your entire process for learning things. You will need to stay
  constantly engaged with the course through participation in class
  meetings and on the class discussion board --- asking questions,
  seeking understanding, and giving help.\\
\item
  \textbf{Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
  course.} Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel
  like you are really struggling with the material --- even if in your
  earlier math courses you might never have experienced struggle.
  \textbf{This is a normal and healthy experience.} When you are
  building physical muscles, the point at which you are growing the most
  is the moment you experience the greatest strain and fatigue.
  Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and
  it's a signal you're about to experience explosive growth. \textbf{Our
  class is a safe place for you to experience those struggles.}
\item
  \textbf{You have a lot of help available to you as you work.}
  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot
  of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily
  available to help in several channels; your classmates will be
  available for help through structured and informal support groups; and
  the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center.
  \textbf{Everyone in the course has your back.}
\item
  \textbf{You will find MTH 225 to be very enjoyable if you embrace the
  challenge.} Although hard work doesn't always feel good in the moment,
  by embracing the challenge and committing to learning Discrete
  Structures, I think you will find that \textbf{growth is fun} and
  \textbf{Discrete Structures is really interesting stuff}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{course-information}{%
\subsection{Course information}\label{course-information}}

\textbf{Instructor}: Robert Talbert, Ph.D., Professor of Mathematics.
Email: talbertr@gvsu.edu. Phone: ???

\textbf{Instructor availability:} My office is Mackinac Hall C-2-513;
however due to public health concerns, \textbf{all student meetings this
semester will be conducted remotely} unless you have a specific need
that requires a physical meeting outside of class. Open drop-in hours
will be held \emph{(insert times here)} through Google Meet, using the
link \emph{(insert link here)}. \textbf{You do not need an appointment
for open drop-in hours; just click the link to join.} (You may be put
into a waiting room if there is a meeting in process.) Outside those
hours, you can contact me by email or phone, through a direct message on
Campuswire, or by scheduling an appointment at
http://rtalbert.youcanbook.me.

\textbf{Limits on availability:} Please note that \textbf{I typically
only check email and other messages between 6am and 6pm on weekdays and
once on Saturday mornings}. If you send a message that needs a response
during those times, \emph{you can expect to get a response within 6
hours}. Otherwise you can expect one when I am back online. Please plan
accordingly --- for example, do not send messages after 6pm with the
expectation of an immediate response. \textbf{If you have a question and
it can be made public, you'll get a much faster response if you post it
to CampusWire instead}.

\textbf{Face-to-face Meetings}: Our class meetings are scheduled for
\textbf{12:00-12:50pm MWF in Mackinac Hall B-1-132}. This course is
being conducted in a \emph{staggered hybrid} mode this semester, in
which your section is split into two groups, called the ``Red'' group
and the ``Blue'' group, and the different groups take turns meeting
face-to-face (F2F) and working online. \textbf{The Red group will always
meet F2F on Mondays; the Blue group meets on Wednesdays; and Fridays the
entire class will meet together in a synchronous online setting}.
Although participation in each meeting is expected, you are \emph{not}
required to be physically present for your group's designated F2F
meeting. See the section ``Structure and Flow of he Course'' below for
details.

\textbf{Textbook:} We will use textbook
\href{http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com/dmoi/}{Discrete Mathematics: An
Open Introduction} by Oscar Levin, which is available for free online at
the link. If you prefer a paper copy,
\href{http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com/download.php}{here are
instructions on how to purchase a printed copy}. The book is not sold in
the GVSU bookstore. Please note, this book does not cover all the
content in the course; content not found in the textbook will use
homemade notes.

\textbf{Course website and discussion board:} All course announcements,
assignments, and grades will be communicated using the course
\textbf{Blackboard} site available at http://mybb.gvsu.edu All other
course communications (including additional examples, guidance on
assignments, etc.) will be available through \textbf{Campuswire}, our
class discussion tool; to join, go to http://www.campuswire.com and use
the code ???.

\textbf{Course calendar:} A Google Calendar for the course, will all due
dates and other important time-sensitive information posted on it, is
available on Blackboard through a link in the left sidebar. \textbf{Be
sure to check the calendar once daily} for upcoming events. The calendar
is kept up-to-date constantly and \textbf{in cases of apparent conflicts
in times or dates, the calendar is considered to be correct always.}

\textbf{Technology:} To use the course tools, you will need to have
access to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{A laptop or tablet device}, preferably one with a
  \textbf{touchscreen that allows writing on the screen with a stylus}.
  Please plan on bringing this device with you to all F2F meetings.
\item
  \textbf{A modern web browser}. Chrome is preferred, but browsers such
  as Firefox and Edge are also fine.
\item
  \textbf{Reliable access to high-speed internet}.
\item
  \textbf{An active GVSU network account} so that you can access email,
  Blackboard, and Google Docs.
\end{itemize}

We will use a variety of course tools during the semester, but these are
free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the
class. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let
me know as soon as possible.

\textbf{What Discrete Structures is about:} \emph{Discrete mathematics}
refers to the study of structures that can be separated and counted. The
word ``discrete'' is the opposite of ``continuous'', which refers to
things that flow together and cannot be easily separated. A useful
analogy comes from sports, namely American football versus soccer.
Whereas the gameplay in soccer is mostly \emph{continuous}, with the
ball passing from one side to the other without breaks, gameplay in
American football is \emph{discrete} with each side taking turns that
are clearly separated and can be counted. Discrete mathematics is the
theoretical foundation for computer science, since computers do not
operate on continuous flows of information but rather through discrete
packets, processed using algorithms that have discrete steps. By
studying discrete structures, you'll gain a foundation for understanding
computing that applies to \emph{any} hardware and \emph{any} software,
including those that haven't been invented yet!

\textbf{Course content:} Key topics in the course will include different
modes of representation of integers (whole numbers), binary and modular
arithmetic, symbolic logic, set theory, functions, counting techniques,
recursion and induction, and the basics of mathematical proof. In every
topic, we seek a \textbf{conceptual understanding} from several
perspectives, the ability to \textbf{apply ideas}, development of
\textbf{logical reasoning and communication skills}, and an
\textbf{appreciation for Discrete Structures as a whole}.

\textbf{Official course description:} . Logic, sets, counting
techniques, cardinality, relations, functions and sequences, matrices,
mathematical induction, and computer science applications. Please see
the mathematics program for placement details. Offered fall and winter
semesters. \emph{Prerequisite}: MTH 122 or MTH 123 or MTH 124 or MTH 201
or assignment through Grand Valley math placement.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives}\label{learning-objectives}}

By the end of this course, successful students will be able to:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Compute basic numerical and symbolic expressions involving numbers in
  different bases, modular arithmetic, sets, functions, and symbolic
  logic.
\item
  Solve complex counting problems using computational thinking and the
  tools of combinatorics.
\item
  Formulate computational problems in terms of sets, functions, logic,
  and combinatorics.
\item
  Write clear, correct, and convincing arguments to explain the
  correctness of a solution using combinatorial proof and mathematical
  induction.
\item
  Apply effective problem-solving skills in solving computational
  problems.
\item
  Explain methods and solutions of computational problems in a clear way
  to a specified target audience.
\item
  Demonstrate fluency in applying computer programming in the
  formulation and solutions of mathematical problems.
\item
  Assess one's own work in mathematical problem solving and apply
  feedback to make improvements to one's own work
\end{enumerate}

Your progress toward these course objectives will be tracked using
\textbf{Learning Targets}. There are 23 individual Learning Targets
covering all the major skills in the course; a complete list of these is
in Appendix ??? at the end of this syllabus. Your grade in the course
will be based in large part on the amount and quality of evidence you
can provide, through various forms of work, that you've mastered these
Learning Targets.

\hypertarget{structure-and-flow-of-the-course}{%
\subsection{Structure and flow of the
course}\label{structure-and-flow-of-the-course}}

Your MTH 225 course is being offered in a \textbf{staggered hybrid}
mode. ``Staggered'' means that while we will have F2F meetings
regularly, we will stagger the attendance so that only about half the
section is in attendance at any give meeting, for social distancing
purposes. ``Hybrid'' means that the course is a combination of F2F work
and asynchronous online work, with about a 50/50 split in our case.

The content of MTH 225 is divided into 12 \textbf{modules}, each of
which is subdivided into a ``Part A'' and a ``Part B''. Each Part of a
module occupies one course meeting, so each week of the course will
focus on one meeting for Part A, another meeting for Part B, then a
third meeting (done sychnronously online) for questions and further work
over the entire module. A complete list of modules and the content they
cover is in Appendix ??? at the end of this syllabus. Your engagement
and work on each module follows a standard pattern:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Before each of the first two days of a module (Part A, and Part B)
  you'll complete a \textbf{Daily Preparation} assignment that leads you
  through independent learning of the basic ideas of new material.
\item
  Then we will have a F2F meeting to do active work on applications and
  analysis of the basic information you learned in the Daily Preparation
  assignment. Whether you are present physically for that meeting
  depends on your group (Red attends on Mondays, Blue on Wednesdays).
\item
  The third day of each module is a catch-all meeting done synchronously
  online. Here, as a large group we'll address any burning questions
  left over from the week, study additional examples, and work on
  additional active learning tasks.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Participation options:} The meetings of the course are set up so
that \textbf{every F2F meeting will be live-streamed}, and \textbf{there
will be asynchronous versions of the synchronous activities available}.
Therefore you will have the option of participating in every F2F meeting
in one of three ways:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{You may attend the F2F meeting in person} if it's your group's
  designated attendance day (Red = Monday, Blue = Wednesday).
\item
  \textbf{You may participate in the F2F meeting synchronously online}
  by watching the live stream and interacting via the chat rooms on
  Campuswire (our class discussion tool) and other tech tools. You may
  do this regardless of whether it is your group's designated day; so
  for example, if you are sick or simply prefer not to be physically
  present, you can participate remotely in this way.
\item
  \textbf{You may interact with the course material through asynchronous
  activities} by completing the special asynchronous versions of the
  course activities that will be posted on Blackboard. For example, if
  you cannot or choose not to be present in class and are having issues
  with synchronous online participation, you may opt to do the
  asynchronous work instead.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Any student may choose to opt out of their designated F2F
meeting and choose the synchronous or asynchronous versions of the
activities, at any time --- no questions asked, no permission needed, no
penalities incurred.}

Although you have the option not to attend your F2F meeting, you are
still encouraged to do so, since you will benefit from the immediate
interaction with your classmates and the instructor. However, given the
realities of this semester and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, you should
rest assured that you are not \emph{required} to attend class physically
if you have any reason not to.

\hypertarget{learning-activities-in-mth-225}{%
\subsection{Learning activities in MTH
225}\label{learning-activities-in-mth-225}}

Both to learn the material and to demonstrate how well you have learned
it, you will be engaging with several different kinds of activities in
the course. Our course uses a \textbf{mastery grading} system in which
\textbf{most graded items do not use points}, but rather your work will
be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate mastery.
We will say much more about this in this syllabus and in class.

The kinds of activities you will undertake are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Daily Preparation (DP)}: You will complete Daily Prep
  assignments before each of your F2F meetings. Each Daily Prep
  assignment involves reading, video-watching, or playing with an
  interactive tool and then answering questions and working exercises on
  basic learning obejctives. Each Daily Prep is graded with a ``check''
  if it is submitted by the deadline (given on the course calendar),
  every exercise has a response, and each response indicates a
  good-faith effort to be right. Otherwise the work receives an ``x''.
\item
  \textbf{Class Activities (CA)}: The first two class meetings of each
  module (typically, but not always, Monday and Wednesday) focus on a
  set of activities. Those activities will be available for those
  participating synchronously, and in a slightly modified form for those
  participating asynchronously. No matter which modality you choose to
  participate in, your work on the activities will be turned in and
  checked for completeness and effort. As with Daily Prep, Class
  Activities are graded with a ``check'' if submitted by the deadline
  (given on the course calendar), every exercise has a response, and
  each response indicates a good-faith effort to be right. Otherwise the
  work receives an ``x''.
\item
  \textbf{Weekly Practice (WP):} In a typical week, you will be given a
  set of exercises that give further practice on the week's concepts.
  These are to be done individually, written up, and turned in on
  Blackboard. They are graded using the ``EMRN'' rubric described later
  in this syllabus. Weekly Practice sets also may contain items done for
  engagement credits (below).
\item
  \textbf{Learning Target Checkpoints}: On a roughly bi-weekly basis,
  you'll receive a take-home exam called a ``Checkpoint'' that consists
  of several problems, each one of which focuses on a single Learning
  Target from the list in the Appendix. Each Checkpoint will contain one
  problem for every Learning Target that has been covered up to that
  point. For example, the first Checkpoint may contain problems for
  Learning Targets A.1 through A.3; the second Checkpoint may contain
  problems for L.1 through L.3 \emph{along with new versions} of
  problems for A.1 through A.3; the third Checkpoint may contain
  problems for L.4 and L.5, \emph{along with new versions} of problems
  for A.1-A.3 and L.1-L.3; and so on. \textbf{You will only need to
  attempt problems for Learning Targets that you have not yet mastered}.
  The cumulative structure allows you to attempt problems multiple times
  in different weeks. Students will be provided with a detailed rubric
  for what constitutes acceptable work on each Checkpoint problem. Work
  that meets the criteria for acceptable work will be given a ``check'';
  work that does not meet the criteria will receive an ``X''.
  \textbf{Work receiving an ``X'' can be redone at any later
  Checkpoint}. See the Revision policy for details. You can also earn a
  ``check'' through means other than Checkpoints; see ??? for details.
\item
  \textbf{Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)}: There will be at least
  8 (but probably more than 8) problem sets given that are focused on
  challenging applications or extensions of the basic ideas from the
  course. Students pick and choose from these and work on them through
  the semester at their own pace. These are graded using the EMRN rubric
  described later and can be revised and resubmitted according to the
  revision policy described later in this syllabus.
\item
  \textbf{Final Exam}: The final exam in the course will consist of two
  parts. The first part consists of big-picture questions on the overall
  ideas of the course and an opportunity to show that you have satisfied
  the three ``CS'' learning objectives (see Appendix). Your performance
  on this part contributes to the plus/minus grade in the course. The
  other part of the final exam will be a last Checkpoint of the semester
  and will give you the chance to meet additional learning targets that
  have not yet been mastered.
\item
  \textbf{Miscellaneous engagement opportunities}: Various other
  activities in the class will give you the opportunity to get and stay
  engaged with the course. These include the Startup assignment in week
  1, occasional discussion board activities, meeting certain incentive
  bonus deadlines, and other items. Designated items will carry 1
  ``engagement credit'', and engagement credits will accumulate through
  the semester. In particular, every ``check'' on a Daily Prep and
  Followup activity is worth 1 engagement credit.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-work-is-graded-in-mth-225}{%
\subsection{How work is graded in MTH
225}\label{how-work-is-graded-in-mth-225}}

\hypertarget{proficiency-and-mastery-on-learning-targets}{%
\subsubsection{Proficiency and Mastery on Learning
Targets}\label{proficiency-and-mastery-on-learning-targets}}

There are 23 Learning Targets in the course, 10 of which are designated
as \textbf{Core} targets due to their central nature in Discrete
Structures, and the other 13 of which are designated as
\textbf{Supplemental}. There are two levels of achievement on any of the
Learning Targets: \textbf{Proficiency} and \textbf{Mastery}. Students
get numerous opportunities to demonstrate understanding of the Learning
Targets; every time this happens, the student receives a ``check'' on
that Learning Target.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To be rated as ``Proficient'' on a Learning Target, earn \textbf{one
  check} on it.
\item
  To be rated as ``Mastered'' on a Learning Target, earn \textbf{two
  checks} on it.
\end{itemize}

You can earn a check on a Learning Target in four different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{(The simplest way)} \textbf{Do work on a Checkpoint} that meets
  the criteria for acceptable quality, as described above,.
\item
  \textbf{Schedule an oral assessment} (on videoconference) during which
  I will give a new version of a Checkpoint-like problem for that
  Learning Target, and you solve that problem ``live'' at an acceptable
  level.
\item
  \textbf{Create a video} of yourself working out the solution to a
  Checkpoint-like problem that I will make for you, then submit the
  video. If you choose this option, you'll also be required to have a
  follow-up video meeting with me to discuss the solution and answer
  additional related questions to make sure you really understand the
  ideas.
\item
  \textbf{Use work on an AEP set} and schedule a videoconference meeting
  with me to argue that your work on the AEP demonstrates mastery of the
  Learning Target, as well as answer follow-up questions. For example,
  you might do work on an AEP that you believe demonstrates proficiency
  with ``find closed-form and recursive expressions for arithmetic and
  geometric sequences and find their sums'' (Learning Target SR.3). If
  so, then you could schedule a meeting with me to explain why you think
  your work satisfied SR.3; I would listen and, if I agree, I might ask
  you to work out a second problem also related to SR.3 to make sure you
  really understand the idea.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Boundaries on these methods:} Please note the following
restrictions on options 2-4 above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{No more than one check per week can be earned through options
  2-4}.
\item
  \emph{Option 3 (make a video) must adhere to standards for video
  creation} (to be posted separately; basically the video must have
  clear sound and audio, and keep face, handwriting, and voice in the
  frame at all times).
\item
  \emph{Mastery (two checks) }must* include at least one Checkpoint
  problem*. That is, you can't earn Mastery on a learning target through
  options 2-4 alone.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CS learning targets}: In addition to the 23 content-oriented
Learning Targets, there are three big-picture oriented learning targets
designated ``CS''. These are satisfied not through checkpoints, but
through a brief portfolio of your semester work that you will provide at
the final exam.

\hypertarget{the-emrn-rubric}{%
\subsubsection{The EMRN rubric}\label{the-emrn-rubric}}

Work on Application/Extension Problems is graded not with points but
with one of four designation: ``E'' (Excellent/Exemplary), ``M'' (Meets
the standard), ``R'' (Needs revision), or ``N'' (Not assessible/Not
enough information). The process of assigning these marks is shown
below:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{EMRN.png}
\caption{EMRN rubric}
\end{figure}

Whenever your work on an AEP is graded, you will be given extensive
actionable feedback on what was done well and what needs improvement.

\hypertarget{how-your-semester-grade-is-determined}{%
\subsubsection{How your semester grade is
determined}\label{how-your-semester-grade-is-determined}}

Your course grade is determined using the table below. In order to earn
a particular letter grade, each requirement must be met in the column
for that grade. Your \emph{base grade} (the letter A,B,C, D, or F
without plus or minus) is \textbf{the highest grade for which all the
requirements are met}.

Note: In the table, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed
to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the
requirement. Also, for AEP's, ``M+'' means ``either M or E''. Finally,
``DP+CA'' refers to the sum of your Daily Prep and Class Activities with
a ``check''; there will be 24 of each, for a maximum total of 48.

A grade of ``F'' is given if not all the requirements for a ``D'' are
met.

\textbf{Plus/minus grades:} Your base grade may be modified with a plus
or minus, according to these guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A ``plus'' is added to the base grade if all requirements for a base
  grade are satisfied, \emph{and} the LT (both Core and Supplemental)
  \emph{or} AEP requirement for the next level up is also satisfied;
  \emph{and} the big-picture portion of the final exam is passed.
\item
  A ``minus'' is added to the base grade above in either of the
  following cases: (1) All requirements for a base grade are satisfied
  \emph{except one}, and that one is no more than two levels below the
  others; \textbf{or} (2) You meet the minimum requirements for a base
  grade but you do not pass the big-picture portion of the final exam.
  In the first case, if the deficient area is more than two levels
  below, the penalty will be either a minus or a full letter grade, at
  my discretion.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{revisions-and-tokens}{%
\subsection{Revisions and tokens}\label{revisions-and-tokens}}

Since your work in the course is not graded with points (or is graded
either 0 or 1), partial credit is not available except for occasional
multi-part WeBWorK items. Instead, almost all work you do in the course
can be revised and resubmitted to allow you to improve your work and
raise your grade.

\textbf{Checkpoint items} can be revised by reattempting the item on a
later Checkpoint or through one of the other means described earlier.
For example if you attempt a Checkpoint problem for Learning Target A.1
and receive an ``x'', you can: redo the problem on a later Checkpoint
(where it will be the same essential task but with different specifics);
schedule an oral exam via video meeting to attempt a different version
of the problem; create a video for a different version of the problem;
or use work on an AEP to argue that you've met the standards for that
target. Remember, though, only one check per week can be earned through
non-Checkpoint methods, and Mastery level on a target requires that at
least one Checkpoint problem earn a ``check''.

\textbf{AEPs} earning M, R, or N can be revised and resubmitted at any
time. They will be regraded using the same standards as originally used.
However, there are two important limitations on your revision and
resubmission of AEP's:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Two-submission-per-week rule: No more than two submissions of
AEP sets may be made per week. This can be two new sets, two revisions,
or one of each.} A third submission can be purchased with a token
(below) but \textbf{four or more submissions in a week are not allowed
under any cirumstance.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Revision of N grades rule: Students have to spend a token
(below) in order to revise any AEP that was graded at ``N'' (Not
Assessable).}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Weekly Practice sets} receiving an R or N can be revised, with
the following limitations: (1) work receiving an ``R'' costs one token
to revise; (2) work receiving an ``N'' costs two tokens to revise; and
(3) no more than one Weekly Practice set may be revised in a given week.

However, \textbf{Daily Prep} and \textbf{Class Activities} may not be
revised at all; these are graded on the basis of completeness and effort
only and are intended to be done once.

\hypertarget{tokens}{%
\subsubsection{Tokens}\label{tokens}}

Tokens are a fake currency that are used to ``purchase'' exceptions to
course policies and other advantageous items in the course. Every
student starts with five of these. One token can be spent for any of the
following at any time:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attempt a second Learning Target in a given week through
  non-Checkpoint means\\
\item
  Submit a third AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given week
\item
  Revise and resubmit an AEP graded ``N''
\item
  Revise and resubmit a Weekly Practice graded ``R''
\item
  (\emph{Two tokens}) Revise and resubmit a Weekly Practice graded ``N''
\item
  Extend the deadline on a Checkpoint by 12 hours (request must be
  submitted prior to the original deadline)
\item
  Extend the deadline on a Weekly Practice set by 24 hours (request must
  be submitted prior to the original deadline)
\item
  Purchase 3 engagement credits
\end{itemize}

To spend a token, please use the \emph{Token Spending form} found on
Blackboard in the left sidebar.

With the exception of the last item, tokens may not be ``stacked'', for
example by spending 3 tokens to get a 72-hour WeBWorK deadline
extension. You can stack tokens to purchase engagement credits
(e.g.~spend 3 to get 9 EC's).

Opportunities to earn more tokens may be given during the semester.

\hypertarget{academic-integrity-in-mth-225}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity in MTH
225}\label{academic-integrity-in-mth-225}}

The university's academic integrity policy is described in the GVSU
Student Code, Section 3.1 which you can read online here:
\url{http://bit.ly/gvsuacademicintegrity}. \textbf{Every student has the
responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially
the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.}

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Daily Prep and Followup Activities}: You may collaborate with
  others, but your writeup must be in your own words. You may not copy
  someone's work and submit it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas
  from someone and simply change the wording.
\item
  \emph{Checkpoints} and other work done on Learning Targets: No
  interations at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on
  the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from
  another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.
\item
  \emph{AEPs}: Similarly, no interations at all with another person or
  with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed.
\item
  \emph{Weekly practice}: You may discuss the general, broad ideas of
  Weekly Practice problems with others (including on Campuswire) but you
  may not use other people's work as your own. You may also not ask for
  specific details of a solution, either in person or on Campuswire.
\end{itemize}

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Daily Prep and Followup: A grade of ``x''
\item
  Checkpoints and other Learning Target work: A grade of ``x'' and
  required expense of two tokens to reattempt; for severe cases, you may
  be barred from reattempting.
\item
  AEP's and Weekly Practice: A grade of ``N'', and you will not be
  allowed to revise or resubmit the AEP for the rest of the semester.
\end{itemize}

Note these are \emph{minimum} penalties; additional penalties may be
given including reduction of course grades and potential suspension from
the university.

\textbf{Please note: There is no need to commit academic dishonesty in
this class since you can revise and resubmit almost anything.} If you
come to believe that cheating or plagiarism is necessary given your
situation: DON'T DO IT. Get some help instead and take comfort in the
fact that you can just submit your best effort, get feedback, and try
again later.

\hypertarget{additional-course-expectations-and-information}{%
\subsection{Additional course expectations and
information}\label{additional-course-expectations-and-information}}

Below are some additional important information about the course. Please
note there is a separate section following this one, with course
policies specific to the Covid-19 pandemic and how the class will be
conducted.

\textbf{Attendance:} Each meeting is set up so that you have the option
to attend F2F if it's your group's day to meet; or you can participate
synchronously online; or you can participate asynchronously. \textbf{You
will learn best if you participate F2F or synchronously. Please reserve
asynchronous participation for cases where synchronous participation is
impossible.} Also please note: \textbf{You may not attend the F2F
meeting for the group other than your own} due to social distancing
requirements; on your group's ``off day'' you are expected to
participate online, again preferably synchronously.

You will be responsible for all announcements made in the F2F meetings
and for all material covered in those meetings. Each meeting will begin
on the hour; please be on time for your meetings. If circumstances
beyond your control prevent you from attending F2F \emph{or}
participating remotely, please let me know so I can help you stay
current.

\textbf{Tech support:} Please note that \textbf{I (Prof.~Talbert) am not
able to provide support for technological issues}. If you encounter
issues with technology, please use the appropriate source of help:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For help with Blackboard}: Email the Blackboard Help Desk at
  bbadmin@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-8526. For hours of operation and
  more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help/.
\item
  \emph{For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing}: Email the
  GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu; or call (616) 331-2101 or toll
  free (855) 435-7488. For hours of operation and more information see
  https://www.gvsu.edu/it/.
\item
  \emph{For specific help with your computer}: Try the GVSU IT Help Desk
  (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer or
  computer store.
\item
  \emph{For help with course tools such as Desmos and Campuswire}: Ask a
  question on the \texttt{\#tech} channel on Campuswire, seek out the
  help documentation in the tool, or do a targeted Google search.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Deadlines and late work:} Deadlines for course work are clearly
indicated on the Course Calendar; in cases of apparent conflict between
dates, always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For Daily Prep and Followup Activities}: No extensions to
  deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all
  items by the deadline.
\item
  \emph{For Checkpoints and Weekly Practice}: Deadlines may be extended
  12 and 24 hours, respectively, by spending a token. No other
  extensions are available.
\item
  \emph{For AEPs}: There is only one deadline for AEP's, namely the last
  day of classes (11:59pm ET, Friday December 11). Otherwise you simply
  submit your work when it is ready to be graded (subject to the
  Two-Item-Per-Week Rule). This deadline will not be extended.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Math Center:} The Math Center, located on the second floor of
Mackinac Hall near the Mathematics Department office, provides a
workspace for students to work on mathematics course assignments and
on-demand help from trained student workers. While most Math Center
staff do not have specific background for MTH 225, they can help with
prerequisite mathematics such as college algebra. The Math Center also
offers online help. Information on hours of operation and online access
will be given during week 1.

\textbf{Special learning needs:} If you have special needs because of
learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to
contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616-331-2490 or
http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ . DSR will help you arrange accommodations.
Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and
ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

\textbf{Basic needs security:} If you have difficulty affording
groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack
a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/}{Replenish}, a food resource for
GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me
about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect
you with other campus resources.

\textbf{Gender identity and expression:} If, for purposes of gender
identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match
your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please
contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's
office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and
will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in
Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

\textbf{Changes to this syllabus:} Changes to this syllabus may occur
during the semester. In those cases, the changes will be announced in
class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given a voice on
how the changes will be implemented. It is your responsibility stay
abreast of the information passed along in course announcements so that
you will be aware of any changes that take place.

\textbf{Credits:} Portions of the language of this syllabus were adapted
from the syllabi of Prof.~Matt Boelkins and Prof.~David Clark, both of
GVSU.

\hypertarget{mth-225-covid-19-policies}{%
\subsection{MTH 225 COVID-19 Policies}\label{mth-225-covid-19-policies}}

As you are well aware, we will be having class this semester while
trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day.
While we can't predict even the near future, the following are general
guidelines and plans for how we can work productively together in the
course.

\hypertarget{taking-care-of-yourself}{%
\subsubsection{Taking care of yourself}\label{taking-care-of-yourself}}

Above all else, \textbf{take care of your own physical and mental
health} during these difficult times. Make sure you are getting
sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving
yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
\href{https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic}{This
website lists several good tips} for maintaining good self-care in our
situation.

Before coming to campus, \textbf{perform a self-evaluation each time}
and \textbf{if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19
symptoms, stay home and participate remotely}. You should be on campus
only if you feel \emph{completely healthy}.

Please know that \textbf{at any time this semester if you feel unable or
unwilling to be present for a F2F meeting, you can opt out of the
meeting and participate remotely --- no questions asked, no permission
needed, no penalty incurred}. Remember that F2F meetings are
live-streamed, and you can participate remotely through Campuswire and
other means, so you will not fall behind if you have to participate from
home. Also note that \emph{there are no graded assessments done in
class} so you will never have to make up work that was turned in during
class.

\hypertarget{keeping-our-class-meetings-safe}{%
\subsubsection{Keeping our class meetings
safe}\label{keeping-our-class-meetings-safe}}

When you are present in a F2F meeting, please observe the following:

\textbf{Wear a mask at all times.} Face coverings, such as masks, are
required to be worn in the classroom. Students who have forgotten their
face coverings may get a disposable mask at a campus office. The
evidence is clear that
\href{https://www.wbtv.com/2020/06/29/demonstration-aims-show-effectiveness-masks/}{face
coverings are a crucial part of keeping coronavirus at bay} and
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/suggested-syllabus-language-for-inclusion-and-equity-132.htm}{support
the university's commitment to providing all members of its community
with an inclusive living and learning environment with equitable
opportunities for success}. GVSU's policy on face coverings is posted on
the
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/face-covering-policy-27.htm}{Lakers
Together web site}. Students who are not able to wear a face covering
due to a medical condition should
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/}{contact Disability Support Services
(DSR)} to discuss their individual situation.

Please note, students who remove their masks during class, wear the mask
incorrectly (for example, with the nose exposed), or refuse to wear mask
at all will be reminded of this policy once, and then asked to leave if
non-compliance continues.

\textbf{Observe proper social distancing.} Your classroom has been
specially arranged so that students are 6 feet apart from each other and
from the professor at all times. This is sufficient for social
distancing and close enough so that 2-3 students can turn to each other
and discuss a concept. We will also leverage technology to allow for
more remote communication, for example using the chat rooms in
Campuswire. \textbf{Please do not encroach on the space of another
person or share physical objects with another such as pens, calculators,
or paper.}

\textbf{Practice appropriate personal hygiene.} Wash your hands
regularly or use hand sanitizer. If you must cough or sneeze, do so
facing away from other people and use the inside of your elbow to cover
your mouth, even if you have a mask on. You may wish to bring sanitizing
wipes to wipe down your desk and seat before and after class.

If you expect any difficulties in abiding by these terms, you should
plan on exercising your options to participate in the course online.

\hypertarget{contingency-plans-for-the-semester}{%
\subsubsection{Contingency plans for the
semester}\label{contingency-plans-for-the-semester}}

We will begin the semester in ``staggered hybrid'' mode, but several
things could happen during the semester that might alter this setup.
Here are the initial plans for the most likely of those things.

\textbf{If the entire university goes fully online:} In this case,
\textbf{all F2F meetings will be replaced by synchronous online
meetings}. No other changes will be made.

\textbf{If the professor cannot be on campus due to self-quarantine, but
not because of illness:} (For example, if my kids or wife get sick or my
daily self-assessment directs me to stay at home) In this case, we will
follow the plan above for if the university goes fully online (above).

\textbf{If the professor cannot be on campus due to having a Covid-19
infection:} In this case, \textbf{the entire course will be moved to an
asynchronous online format} until I am well enough to resume teaching. A
proxy/substitute may be appointed to grade and give feedback on Daily
Prep and Class Activities; all other graded work will be suspended until
I am well enough to grade.

In the latter two eventualities, you can expect a slowdown in the
grading process and significant changes to the course calendar or
syllabus. Please monitor your course announcements on a twice-daily
basis to ensure you have correct information.

\emph{Please note}: These plans may be changed overridden by
university-wide directives as the semester unfolds. Again, check course
announcements twice daily.

\hypertarget{encouragement}{%
\subsubsection{Encouragement}\label{encouragement}}

Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know
that \textbf{GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe
from Covid-19}. In my view, GVSU's campus is at least as safe from
Covid-19 as the average large supermarket, which many of us visit on a
regular basis now without much trepidation. Furthermore I believe that
\textbf{if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described
here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there's no
reason to be afraid.} We will still learn and grow intellectually just
as in ``normal'' times if we stay focused and work together.
