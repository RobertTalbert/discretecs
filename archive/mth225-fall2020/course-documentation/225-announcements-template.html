<p>Welcome to week 8. This week we start a three-module group on <b>counting complex arrangements</b>, the area of mathematics and computer science known as <b>combinatorics</b>. Counting sounds like kid stuff, except the things we'll be counting are <em>pretty complicated</em>.   </p>

<p>Our schedule for the week is:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Monday:</b> In Module 7A, we'll introduce the <b>additive and multiplicative principles</b> for counting.</li>
    <li><b>Wednesday:</b> Then in Module 7B, we introduce one of the most important tools of the course, the <b>binomial coefficient</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Friday:</b> Our Friday class will, as usual, be determined by your interests and needs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some class announcements for this week:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Upcoming calendar shift:</b> As I've mentioned, I'm giving you a faux-Fall Break by declaring Monday October 26 to be a free day for MTH 225. We will not hold class as usual; the meeting time will be used as open drop-in hours on Zoom. <b>This will shift our entire schedule forward two days from October 26 through Thanksgiving.</b> For example, our "Friday classes" will now be on Mondays; Daily Prep assignments for the "A" parts of Modules will be due on Tuesday nights instead of Sundays; and so on. <b>This is a pretty significant disruption and you'll need to be very clear about what's on the calendar in order to avoid missing a deadline</b>.   </li>
    <li><b>Class meetings during the shift period:</b> After we take our "Fall Break" on October 26, <b>classes will still meet F2F on Mondays and Wednesday and will still be fully online on Fridays.</b> In other words we will NOT change the "modality" of our meetings --- only what we cover and do in those meetings. We will still have Red group F2F and Blue group online on Mondays, Blue group F2F and Red group online on Wednesdays, and everyone online on Fridays. Of course you can still opt out of your F2F meetings and participate online any time, as usual.    </li>
    <li><b>Reminder of F2F attendance:</b> To repeat an announcement from earlier this week, F2F attendance has remained at a low enough level that <b>if you wish to attend the class F2F on both Mondays and Wednesdays, you may do so.</b> If we have an unexpected surge of F2F attendance so that more than 15 people are trying to attend on a given day, those whose group is scheduled for that day may stay, while the others will need to find a separate space. (This seems highly unlikely given recent attendance trends.)    </li>
    <li><b>Reminder of AEP incentive:</b>  Today (October 18) is the second deadline for the AEP completion incentive bonus (earn at least one M or E grade to get 10 engagement credits). Next week (October 25) is the third and final deadline. </li>
</ul>

<p>Here's what's due this week:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Sunday October 18:</b> Daily Prep Module 7A; Weekly Practice 6</li>
    <li><b>Monday :</b> Nothing</li>
    <li><b>Tuesday :</b> Daily Prep for Module 7B</li>
    <li><b>Wednesday :</b> Nothing</li>
    <li><b>Thursday 10/1:</b> Nothing</li>
    <li><b>Friday 10/2:</b> Nothing</li>
    <li><b>Saturday 10/3:</b> Nothing</li>
    <li><b>Sunday 10/4:</b> Weekly Practice 7 (Daily Prep for 8A isn't due until Tuesday October 27 because of the upcoming calendar shift)</li>
</ul>


<p>Here's a suggested work plan for the week. As always, this assumes you are putting aside 2 hours per weekday for work on MTH 225; if you can do that, and stick to the plan, you'll be free and clear for the weekend.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Monday:</b> Pick an AEP and work on it for 30-60 minutes. Then spend 30 minutes getting started on Weekly Practice 7, and 30 minutes split between getting started on Daily Prep 7B and catching up on your Campuswire post reading.  </li>
    <li><b>Tuesday:</b> 30-45 minutes to complete Daily Prep Module 7B; 30 more minutes on Weekly Practice 7; 30 more minutes on an AEP or revision of an AEP.  </li>
    <li><b>Wednesday:</b> 30 minutes on an AEP or revision, or 30 minutes on a revision of a Weekly Practice. With any remaining time, work ahead on Daily Prep and other tasks. </li>
    <li><b>Thursday:</b> 30 minutes getting started on Daily Prep Module 8A; 30 minutes on Weekly Practice; then 30 minutes on a task of your choice. </li>
    <li><b>Friday:</b> 30 minutes finishing up Weekly Practice 7; 30 minutes completing the Daily Prep for Module 8A; 30 minutes completing and submitting a draft of an AEP or a revision of one; then 30 minutes to call your parents --- they miss you. </li>
</ul>
