\section{MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science
1}\label{mth-225-discrete-structures-for-computer-science-1}}

Fall 2020 Semester, Grand Valley State University

\hypertarget{start-here}{%
\subsection{START HERE}\label{start-here}}

Welcome to MTH 225! I'm Robert Talbert, a professor in the Mathematics
Department, and I am grateful that you are signed up for the course and
am looking forward to working with you this semester.

Before reading any further, here are some first things to know:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{My highest priority this semester is your success in this
  course.} I am committed to helping you be successful in MTH 225 this
  semester. ``Success'' in the course is more than just good grades. It
  means that you are being \textbf{challenged} to grow as a learner,
  that you are \textbf{engaging actively} with tasks that feed your
  growth, and that you are creating \textbf{excellent work} in
  mathematics by completing challenging Discrete Structures-related
  tasks with a appropriate level of support. It also means that you are
  \textbf{building your lifelong learning skills} so that once the
  course is over, you are better and stronger as a learner and can
  continue to \textbf{learn new things independently}, and especially go
  on to \textbf{success in courses that have MTH 225 as a prerequisite}.
\item
  \textbf{College level mathematics is more than just computation.} On
  the pathway to ``success'' as outlined above, you will be asked to do
  more than just perform computations. You will be working on
  \textbf{explaining the meaning} of mathematical processes and results
  in oral and written forms to different audiences; \textbf{working on
  realistic applications} of basic skills to authentic problems;
  \textbf{extending basic ideas} to more advanced concepts; and
  \textbf{seeking true understanding} of underlying concepts. In fact,
  many of the computations you might do with algebra in high school
  level mathematics will be automated through computers in MTH 225, and
  your work will mostly focus on these higher-level tasks.
\item
  \textbf{You can expect to be challenged intellectually throughout this
  course.} None of these elements of ``success'' come easily. They
  require dedicated devotion of time and energy to wrestling with the
  concepts and tasks in the course. This will require you to leave your
  comfort zones on a regular basis. You may find that you need to rewire
  your entire process for learning things. You will need to stay
  constantly engaged with the course through participation in class
  meetings and on the class discussion board: asking questions, seeking
  understanding, and giving help.\\
\item
  \textbf{Intellectual struggle is normal and healthy in a challenging
  course.} Since none of this is easy, you can expect at times to feel
  like you are really struggling with the material, even if in your
  earlier math courses you might never have experienced struggle.
  \textbf{This is a normal and healthy experience.} When you are
  building physical muscles, the point at which you are growing the most
  is the moment you experience the greatest strain and fatigue.
  Legitimate struggle is actually a sign you are doing things right, and
  it's a signal you're about to experience explosive growth. \textbf{Our
  class is a safe place for you to experience those struggles.}
\item
  \textbf{You have a lot of help available to you as you work.}
  Throughout the semester, you will be challenged but also given a lot
  of support to help you rise to the challenge. I will be readily
  available to help in several channels; your classmates will be
  available for help through structured and informal support groups; and
  the GVSU Math Department provides free help through the Math Center.
  \textbf{Everyone in the course has your back.}
\item
  \textbf{You will find MTH 225 to be very enjoyable if you embrace the
  challenge.} Although hard work doesn't always feel good in the moment,
  by embracing the challenge and committing to learning Discrete
  Structures, I think you will find that \textbf{growth is fun} and
  \textbf{Discrete Structures is really interesting stuff}.
\end{enumerate}

Finally please note that it's extremely important given our course setup
and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic that you \textbf{check your
email and Blackboard announcements at least once per day} and preferably
more than this. All course information will be sent out as soon as
possible; it's up to you to maintain awareness and act accordingly.

\hypertarget{course-information}{%
\subsection{Course Information}\label{course-information}}

\textbf{Instructor}: Robert Talbert, Ph.D., Professor of Mathematics.
Email: talbertr@gvsu.edu. Phone: 331-8968.

\textbf{Office:} My office is \textbf{Mackinac Hall C-2-513}. All
student meetings this semester will be conducted online unless you have
a specific need that requires a physical meeting.

\textbf{Open drop-in hours:} \textbf{Monday through Thursday, 1-1:50pm},
using the link \url{http://gvsu.edu/s/1qX} and password
\textbf{growthmind}. \textbf{You do not need an appointment.} If you
cannot attend open drop-in hours, you can contact me by email, through a
Campuswire direct message, or by scheduling an appointment at
http://rtalbert.youcanbook.me.

\textbf{Availability:} I typically only check email and other messages
between 6am and 6pm on weekdays and once on Saturday mornings. If you
send a message that needs a response during those times, you can expect
to get a response within 6 hours. Otherwise you can expect one when I am
back online.

\textbf{Face-to-face Meetings}: 12:00-12:50pm MWF in Mackinac Hall
B-1-132. The course uses a \emph{synchronous staggered hybrid} setup in
which your section is split into two groups: \textbf{Red} and
\textbf{Blue}. The \textbf{Red} group meets face to face (F2F) on
\textbf{Mondays}; the \textbf{Blue} group meets F2F on
\textbf{Wednesdays}; and on Fridays the entire class meets synchronously
online. Please note that \textbf{all students are expected to
participate in all meetings}; if it is not your group's designated F2F
day, you'll participate remotely via a live stream. Please see
``Structure and Flow of the Course'' below for more information on
accessibility and attendance expectations.

\textbf{Textbook:}
\href{http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com/dmoi/}{Discrete Mathematics: An
Open Introduction} by Oscar Levin, which is available for free online at
the link. If you prefer a paper copy,
\href{http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com/download.php}{here are
instructions on how to purchase a printed copy}. The book is not sold in
the GVSU bookstore. Please note, this book does not cover all the
content in the course; content not found in the textbook will use
homemade notes.

\textbf{Course website and discussion board:} All course announcements,
assignments, and grades will be communicated using the course
\textbf{Blackboard} site available at http://mybb.gvsu.edu All other
course communications (including additional examples, guidance on
assignments, etc.) will be available through \textbf{Campuswire}, our
class discussion tool; to join, go to http://www.campuswire.com and use
the code ???.

\textbf{Course calendar:} A calendar for the course, will all due dates
and other important time-sensitive information posted on it, is
available on Blackboard through a link in the left sidebar. \textbf{Be
sure to check the calendar once daily} for upcoming events. The calendar
is kept up-to-date constantly and \textbf{in cases of apparent conflicts
in times or dates, the calendar is considered to be correct always.}

\textbf{Technology:} To use the course tools, you will need to have
access to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{A laptop or tablet device}, preferably one with a
  \textbf{touchscreen that allows writing on the screen with a stylus}.
  Please plan on bringing this device with you to all F2F meetings.
\item
  \textbf{A modern web browser}. Chrome is preferred, but browsers such
  as Firefox and Edge are also fine.
\item
  \textbf{Reliable access to high-speed internet}.
\item
  \textbf{An active GVSU network account} so that you can access email,
  Blackboard, and Google Docs.
\end{itemize}

We will use a variety of course tools during the semester, but these are
free to use, and you will be taught how to use them as part of the
class. If you have any issue with accessing any of the above, please let
me know as soon as possible.

\textbf{What Discrete Structures is about:} \emph{Discrete mathematics}
refers to the study of structures that can be separated and counted. The
word ``discrete'' is the opposite of ``continuous'', which refers to
things that flow together and cannot be easily separated. A useful
analogy comes from sports, namely American football versus soccer.
Whereas the gameplay in soccer is mostly \emph{continuous}, with the
ball passing from one side to the other without breaks, gameplay in
American football is \emph{discrete} with each side taking turns that
are clearly separated and can be counted. Discrete mathematics is the
theoretical foundation for computer science, since computers do not
operate on continuous flows of information but rather through discrete
packets, processed using algorithms that have discrete steps. By
studying discrete structures, you'll gain a foundation for understanding
computing that applies to \emph{any} hardware and \emph{any} software,
including those that haven't been invented yet!

\textbf{Course content:} Key topics in the course will include different
modes of representation of integers (whole numbers), binary and modular
arithmetic, symbolic logic, set theory, functions, counting techniques,
recursion and induction, and the basics of mathematical proof. In every
topic, we seek a \textbf{conceptual understanding} from several
perspectives, the ability to \textbf{apply ideas}, development of
\textbf{logical reasoning and communication skills}, and an
\textbf{appreciation for Discrete Structures as a whole}.

\textbf{Official course description:} . Logic, sets, counting
techniques, cardinality, relations, functions and sequences, matrices,
mathematical induction, and computer science applications. Please see
the mathematics program for placement details. Offered fall and winter
semesters. \emph{Prerequisite}: MTH 122 or MTH 123 or MTH 124 or MTH 201
or assignment through Grand Valley math placement.

\hypertarget{structure-and-flow-of-the-course}{%
\subsection{Structure and flow of the
course}\label{structure-and-flow-of-the-course}}

\textbf{Default setup:} This section of MTH 225 uses a
\textbf{synchronous staggered hybrid} format. In practice, this will
work as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The class roster is divided into two groups (Red and Blue).
\item
  The Monday and Wednesday meetings will be F2F and live-streamed on
  Zoom or Google Meet. On \emph{Mondays}, the \textbf{Red} group meets
  F2F while the Blue group participates remotely through the live
  stream; on \emph{Wednesdays}, the \textbf{Blue} team meets F2F while
  the Red group participates remotely through the live stream; and on
  \emph{Fridays}, the entire class meets together synchronously online.
\end{itemize}

Please note, \textbf{all students are expected to participate in all
meetings}. If it's not your group's designated F2F day, then you should
plan on participating remotely. Please do not schedule plans that
conflict with remote participation on the days you're not meeting F2F.

\textbf{Multiple ways to participate:} You should plan on following the
default setup above for course participation (attend F2F one day per
week, participate synchronously online the other two days). However, to
give you maximum flexibility and choice for how to interact with the
course, \textbf{(1) you are free to opt out of your group's F2F meeting
and participate synchronously online} if you wish; and \textbf{(2)
special asynchronous versions of class activities will be posted} for
those who cannot or choose not to attend the synchronous sessions. What
this means is that:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Any student may choose to opt out of their designated F2F
meeting and choose the synchronous or asynchronous versions of the
activities, at any time. No questions asked, no permission needed, no
penalities incurred.}
\end{quote}

It's possible to complete the entire course without attending a single
F2F meeting if you use this option repeatedly. This is allowed, but the
default setup of one F2F meeting per week is probably the most
beneficial for your learning. So again, please plan on following the
\emph{default} setup unless you have good reason.

Please note you may \emph{not} choose to attend the F2F meeting of the
other group (that is, Red students may not attend Wednesday F2F meetings
and Blue students may not attend Monday F2F meetings) because of social
distancing constraints.

\textbf{How you'll participate in the course:} The material in MTH 225
is split up into 12 \textbf{modules}, each lasting about three class
days and focused on a single theme. (See the Appendix for a list.) The
first two days of a module are designated as ``Part A'' and ``Part B''
and are focused on learning activities to gain skill with the Learning
Targets in the course (described later). The third day is set aside as a
catch-all day to deal with open questions, further examples, and other
things you need to know. Your work in the class will follow a basic
pattern:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{BEFORE each class}: You'll complete a \textbf{Daily Prep}
  assignment in which you'll get familiar with the basic concepts of the
  upcoming lesson. Daily Prep assignments will typically be due by
  11:59pm ET the night before the lesson; you'll be able to work ahead
  if you want.
\item
  \textbf{DURING each class}: Class meetings will typically start with
  10 minutes for going over the Daily Prep assignments and fielding
  questions. Then we will spend around 30 minutes doing activities
  together on the harder concepts from the material. Then we will
  typically spend 10 minutes wrapping up, going through some of the main
  points of the activity, taking short ungraded quizzes to give you
  feedback on your learning, and getting your feedback on the lesson.
\item
  \textbf{AFTER each class}: Students choosing the asynchronous version
  of the class activities will complete those activities and submit them
  within a 24-hour window. (Students attending F2F or synchronously
  online will complete these during their meetings.)
\end{itemize}

Finally, there is ongoing work outside the flow of class meetings, such
as weekly practice homework and application/extension problems. More on
these in the ``Learning Activities in MTH 225'' section below.

\hypertarget{learning-activities-in-mth-225}{%
\subsection{Learning activities in MTH
225}\label{learning-activities-in-mth-225}}

Both to learn the material and to demonstrate how well you have learned
it, you will be engaging with several different kinds of activities in
the course. Our course uses a \textbf{mastery grading} system in which
\textbf{most graded items do not use points}, but rather your work will
be required to meet certain levels of quality that demonstrate mastery.
We will say much more about this in this syllabus and in class.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Daily Preparation (DP)}: You will complete Daily Prep
  assignments before each of your F2F meetings. Each Daily Prep
  assignment involves reading, video-watching, or playing with an
  interactive tool and then answering questions and working exercises on
  basic learning obejctives. Each Daily Prep is graded with a ``check''
  if it is submitted by the deadline (given on the course calendar),
  every exercise has a response, and each response indicates a
  good-faith effort to be right. Otherwise the work receives an ``x''.
\item
  \textbf{Class Activities (CA)}: The first two class meetings of each
  module focus on a set of activities. Those activities will be
  available for those participating synchronously, and in a slightly
  modified form for those participating asynchronously. Your work on the
  activities will be turned in and checked for completeness and effort.
  As with Daily Prep, Class Activities are graded with a ``check'' if
  submitted by the deadline (given on the course calendar), every
  exercise has a response, and each response indicates a good-faith
  effort to be right. Otherwise the work receives an ``x''.
\item
  \textbf{Weekly Practice (WP):} In a typical week, you will be given a
  set of exercises that give further practice on the week's concepts.
  These are to be done individually, written up, and turned in on
  Blackboard. They are graded using the ``EMRN'' rubric described later
  in this syllabus. Weekly Practice sets also may contain items done for
  engagement credits (below).
\item
  \textbf{Learning Target Checkpoints}: On a roughly bi-weekly basis,
  you'll receive a take-home exam called a \emph{Checkpoint} that
  consists of several problems, each one of which focuses on a single
  Learning Target from the list in the Appendix. Each Checkpoint will
  contain one problem for every Learning Target that has been covered up
  to that point. These Checkpoints offer opportunities to demonstrate
  mastery of Learning Targets. \textbf{You will only need to attempt
  problems for Learning Targets that you have not yet mastered}. The
  cumulative structure allows you to attempt problems multiple times in
  different weeks. Students will be provided with a detailed rubric for
  what constitutes acceptable work on each Checkpoint problem. Work that
  meets the criteria for acceptable work will be given a ``check''; work
  that does not meet the criteria will receive an ``X''. \textbf{Work
  receiving an ``X'' can be redone at any later Checkpoint}. See the
  Revision policy for details. You can also earn a ``check'' through
  other means.
\item
  \textbf{Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)}: There will be at least
  8 problem sets given that are focused on challenging applications or
  extensions of the basic ideas from the course. Students pick and
  choose from these and work on them through the semester at their own
  pace. These are graded using the EMRN rubric described later and can
  be revised and resubmitted according to the revision policy described
  later in this syllabus.
\item
  \textbf{Miscellaneous engagement opportunities}: Various other
  activities in the class will give you the opportunity to get and stay
  engaged with the course. These include the Startup assignment in week
  1, occasional discussion board activities, meeting certain incentive
  bonus deadlines, and other items. Designated items will carry 1
  ``engagement credit'', and engagement credits will accumulate through
  the semester. In particular, every ``check'' on a Daily Prep and
  Followup activity is worth 1 engagement credit.
\end{itemize}

We will also have a \textbf{Final Exam} consisting of two parts. The
first part consists of big-picture questions on the overall ideas of the
course and an opportunity to show that you have satisfied the three
``CS'' learning objectives (see Appendix). Your performance on this part
contributes to the plus/minus grade in the course. The other part of the
final exam will be a last Checkpoint of the semester and will give you
the chance to meet additional learning targets that have not yet been
mastered. The Final Exam will be done asynchronously and will be
assigned on Wednesday, December 16 and due on Friday, December 18.

\hypertarget{how-work-is-graded}{%
\subsection{How work is graded}\label{how-work-is-graded}}

\textbf{Grading of Daily Prep and Class Activities:} Daily Prep and
Class Activities are graded with either a ``check'' or an ``x''.
\textbf{A ``check'' is given if the work is turned in on time, and if
every item has a response that represents a good-faith effort to be
right}. Actual correctness of the answer or explanation is not part of
the grading. Work that does not meet these expectations receives an
``x''. This includes work that has missing responses (even if by
accident), work that includes responses like ``I don't know'' that show
insufficient effort to give a good-faith response, and work that is late
(again, even if by accident).

\textbf{Grading for Weekly Practice and AEPs:} These two items are
graded on the correctness of the work and (especially) the quality of
the reasoning presented, using one of four labels: \textbf{E}
(Excellent/Exemplary), \textbf{M} (Meets Expectations), \textbf{R}
(Needs Revision), or \textbf{N} (Not Enough Information/Not Assessable).
The grade is assigned using this visual flowchart:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{EMRN.png}
\caption{EMRN rubric}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Learning Targets and Checkpoints:} The main concepts to be
learned in the course are represented in 23 \textbf{Learning Targets}.
Ten of these are designated as \textbf{Core} Learning Targets because
they are most essential concepts of the course; the other 13 are
designated as \textbf{Supplemental} Learning Targets. There are also
three special Learning Targets labeled ``CS'' that deal with big-picture
skills; these are dealt with on the final exam and are not included in
the grading process below.

One of your goals in the course is to \textbf{demonstrate proficiency
and (eventually) mastery of the Learning Targets}. You will do so
through work on Checkpoints and approved alternatives to Checkpoints.
Every time you provide evidence of skill and mastery of a Learning
Target, you earn a ``check'' on that Target. There are two levels of
ratings possible on any Learning Target:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Proficiency}, which you earn by \textbf{earning one check on
  the Target}; and
\item
  \textbf{Mastery}, which you earn by \textbf{earning two checks on the
  Target}.
\end{itemize}

You can earn a check on a Learning Target in four different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{(The simplest way)} \textbf{Do work on a Checkpoint} that meets
  the criteria for acceptable quality.
\item
  \textbf{Schedule an oral assessment} (on videoconference) during which
  I will give a new version of a Checkpoint-like problem for that
  Learning Target, and you solve that problem ``live'' at an acceptable
  level.
\item
  \textbf{Create a video} of yourself working out the solution to a
  Checkpoint-like problem that I will make for you, then submit the
  video. If you choose this option, you'll also be required to have a
  follow-up video meeting with me to discuss the solution and answer
  additional related questions to make sure you really understand the
  ideas.
\item
  \textbf{Use work on an AEP set} and schedule a videoconference meeting
  with me to argue that your work on the AEP demonstrates mastery of the
  Learning Target, as well as answer follow-up questions. For example,
  you might do work on an AEP that you believe demonstrates proficiency
  with ``find{[}ing{]} closed-form and recursive expressions for
  arithmetic and geometric sequences and find their sums'' (Learning
  Target SR.3). If so, then you could schedule a meeting with me to
  explain why you think your work satisfied SR.3; I would listen and, if
  I agree, I might ask you to work out a second problem also related to
  SR.3 to make sure you really understand the idea.
\end{enumerate}

Please note the following restrictions on options 2-4 above:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{No more than one check per week can be earned through options
  2-4}.
\item
  \emph{Option 3 (make a video) must adhere to standards for video
  creation} (to be posted separately; basically the video must have
  clear sound and audio, and keep face, handwriting, and voice in the
  frame at all times).
\item
  \emph{Mastery (two checks) }must* include at least one Checkpoint
  problem*. That is, you can't earn Mastery on a learning target through
  options 2-4 alone.
\end{itemize}

So for example, to earn a Mastery rating on Learning Target S.4 (\emph{I
can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or
bijective}) you could:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Do satisfactory work on a Checkpoint problem for S.4, then do it again
  on a later Checkpoint problem (which would be a new version of the
  same problem you did earlier). Most students will earn mastery on most
  learning targets this way.
\item
  Do satisfactory work on a Checkpoint problem for S.4, then do it again
  via an oral exam. Or do it this way but in reverse order (oral exam
  first then a Checkpoint).
\item
  Do satisfactory work on a Checkpoint problem for S.4, then show me
  some work you did on an AEP that, in your view, shows you have
  mastered determining whether a function is injective, surjective, or
  bijective.
\end{itemize}

Other combinations are possible. However, note that for Mastery (two
checks) at least one check must come through a Checkpoint, so you
wouldn't be able for example to do an oral exam and then show me AEP
work.

\hypertarget{how-your-semester-grade-is-determined}{%
\subsection{How your semester grade is
determined}\label{how-your-semester-grade-is-determined}}

Your course grade is earned not through accumulating points but by
\textbf{amassing a body of evidence from across all the work in the
course that you have mastered the content and concepts of Discrete
Structures}. To determine your \emph{base grade} (the letter A,B,C, D,
or F without plus or minus), look at the records of what you've
completed and then consult the table below. Your base grade \textbf{the
highest grade for which all the requirements are met}.

Note: In the table, numerical values indicate the minimum level needed
to meet the requirement; amounts above this level also meet the
requirement. Also, for AEP's, ``M+'' means ``either M or E''. Finally,
``DP+CA'' refers to the sum of your Daily Prep and Class Activities with
a ``check''; there will be 24 of each, for a maximum total of 48.

\textbf{Example}: A student who completes the course having earned
Mastery on all 10 Core Learning Targets and 4 Supplemental Learning
Targets; earned Proficiency on 5 more Supplemental Targets; earned ``E''
grades on 5 AEPs and an ``M'' grade on a sixth one; earned ``M'' grades
on 8 Weekly Practice assignments; earned a total of 42 checks on Daily
Prep and Class Activities; and has 65 Engagement Credits has earned a
``B'' in the course for the base grade.

A grade of ``F'' is given if not all the requirements for a ``D'' are
met.

\textbf{Plus/minus grades:} Your base grade may be modified with a plus
or minus, according to these guidelines:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A ``plus'' is added to the base grade if all requirements for a base
  grade are satisfied, \emph{and} the LT (both Core and Supplemental)
  \emph{or} AEP requirement for the next level up is also satisfied;
  \emph{and} the big-picture portion of the final exam is passed.
\item
  A ``minus'' is added to the base grade above in either of the
  following cases: (1) All requirements for a base grade are satisfied
  \emph{except one}, and that one is no more than two levels below the
  others; \textbf{or} (2) You meet the minimum requirements for a base
  grade but you do not pass the big-picture portion of the final exam.
  In the first case, if the deficient area is more than two levels
  below, the penalty will be either a minus or a full letter grade, at
  my discretion.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{revisions-and-tokens}{%
\subsection{Revisions and tokens}\label{revisions-and-tokens}}

Since your work in the course is not graded with points (or is graded
either 0 or 1), partial credit is not available except for occasional
multi-part WeBWorK items. Instead, almost all work you do in the course
can be revised and resubmitted to allow you to improve your work and
raise your grade.

\textbf{Checkpoint items} can be revised by reattempting the item on a
later Checkpoint or through one of the other means described earlier.
For example if you attempt a Checkpoint problem for Learning Target A.1
and receive an ``x'', you can: redo the problem on a later Checkpoint
(where it will be the same essential task but with different specifics);
schedule an oral exam via video meeting to attempt a different version
of the problem; create a video for a different version of the problem;
or use work on an AEP to argue that you've met the standards for that
target. Remember, though, only one check per week can be earned through
non-Checkpoint methods, and Mastery level on a target requires that at
least one Checkpoint problem earn a ``check''.

\textbf{AEPs} earning M, R, or N can be revised and resubmitted at any
time. They will be regraded using the same standards as originally used.
However, there are two important limitations on your revision and
resubmission of AEP's:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Two-submission-per-week rule: No more than two submissions of
AEP sets may be made per week. This can be two new sets, two revisions,
or one of each.} A third submission can be purchased with a token
(below) but \textbf{four or more submissions in a week are not allowed
under any cirumstance.}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Revision of N grades rule: Students have to spend a token
(below) in order to revise any AEP that was graded at ``N'' (Not
Assessable).}
\end{quote}

\textbf{Weekly Practice sets} receiving an R or N can be revised, with
the limitation that work receiving an ``N'' costs one token to revise
(same as with AEPs); and no more than one Weekly Practice set may be
revised in a given week.

\textbf{Daily Prep} and \textbf{Class Activities} may not be revised at
all; these are graded on the basis of completeness and effort only and
are intended to be done once.

\textbf{Tokens:} Tokens are a fake currency that are used to
``purchase'' exceptions to course policies and other advantageous items
in the course. Every student starts with five of these. One token can be
spent for any of the following at any time:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Attempt a second Learning Target in a given week through
  non-Checkpoint means\\
\item
  Submit a third AEP (either revision or new submission) in a given week
\item
  Revise and resubmit an AEP graded ``N''
\item
  Revise and resubmit a Weekly Practice graded ``N''
\item
  Extend the deadline on a Checkpoint by 12 hours (request must be
  submitted prior to the original deadline)
\item
  Extend the deadline on a Weekly Practice set by 24 hours (request must
  be submitted prior to the original deadline)
\item
  Purchase 3 engagement credits
\end{itemize}

With the exception of the last item, tokens may not be ``stacked'', for
example by spending 3 tokens to get a 72-hour WeBWorK deadline
extension. You can stack tokens to purchase engagement credits
(e.g.~spend 3 to get 9 EC's).

\hypertarget{academic-integrity-in-mth-225}{%
\subsection{Academic integrity in MTH
225}\label{academic-integrity-in-mth-225}}

The university's academic integrity policy is described in the GVSU
Student Code, Section 3.1 which you can read online here:
\url{http://bit.ly/gvsuacademicintegrity}. \textbf{Every student has the
responsibility of reading and understanding these policies, especially
the consequences for engaging in academically dishonest activities.}

Some of the work you will do in the course involves collaboration; at
other times collaboration may be allowed but not required; while at
others it may not be allowed. Here are the rules for collaboration on
each kind of work you do:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Daily Prep and Followup Activities}: You may collaborate with
  others, but your writeup must be in your own words. You may not copy
  someone's work and submit it as your own, nor may you copy the ideas
  from someone and simply change the wording.
\item
  \emph{Checkpoints} and other work done on Learning Targets: No
  interations at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on
  the internet is allowed. Any evidence of using information from
  another person or source will be investigated as academic dishonesty.
\item
  \emph{AEPs}: Similarly, no interations at all with another person or
  with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed.
\item
  \emph{Weekly practice}: You may discuss the general, broad ideas of
  Weekly Practice problems with others (including on Campuswire) but you
  may not use other people's work as your own. You may also not ask for
  specific details of a solution, either in person or on Campuswire.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{In particular, use of ``study'' sites such as Chegg or
Coursehero, or Q\&A sites like Stack Exchange or Quora, to obtain help
on graded work other than Daily Prep or Class Activities is forbidden
and will automatically constitute academic dishonesty.}

All suspected instances of academic dishonesty will be thoroughly
investigated, and whether a student has committed academic dishonesty is
my determination to make based on the evidence. If I determine academic
dishonesty has been committed, a report will be filed with the Dean of
Students office, and the minimum penalty will be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Daily Prep and Class Activities: A grade of ``x''
\item
  Checkpoints and other Learning Target work: A grade of ``x'' and
  required expense of two tokens to reattempt; for severe cases, you may
  be barred from reattempting.
\item
  AEP's and Weekly Practice: A grade of ``N'', and you will not be
  allowed to revise or resubmit the AEP for the rest of the semester.
\end{itemize}

Note these are \emph{minimum} penalties; additional penalties may be
given including reduction of course grades and potential suspension from
the university.

\textbf{Please note: There is no need to commit academic dishonesty in
this class since you can revise and resubmit almost anything.} If you
come to believe that cheating or plagiarism is necessary given your
situation: DON'T DO IT. Get some help instead and take comfort in the
fact that you can just submit your best effort, get feedback, and try
again later.

\hypertarget{additional-course-expectations-and-information}{%
\subsection{Additional course expectations and
information}\label{additional-course-expectations-and-information}}

Below are some additional important information about the course. Please
note there is a separate section following this one, with course
policies specific to the Covid-19 pandemic and how the class will be
conducted.

\textbf{Attendance:} Each meeting is set up so that you have the option
to attend F2F if it's your group's day to meet; or you can participate
synchronously online; or you can participate asynchronously. \textbf{You
will learn best if you participate F2F or synchronously. Please reserve
asynchronous participation for cases where synchronous participation is
impossible.} Also please note: \textbf{You may not attend the F2F
meeting for the group other than your own} due to social distancing
requirements; on your group's ``off day'' you are expected to
participate online, again preferably synchronously.

You will be responsible for all announcements made in the F2F meetings
and for all material covered in those meetings. Each meeting will begin
on the hour; please be on time for your meetings. If circumstances
beyond your control prevent you from attending F2F \emph{or}
participating remotely, please let me know so I can help you stay
current.

\textbf{Tech support:} Please note that \textbf{I (Prof.~Talbert) am not
able to provide support for technological issues}. If you encounter
issues with technology, please use the appropriate source of help:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For help with Blackboard}: Email the Blackboard Help Desk at
  bbadmin@gvsu.edu or call (616) 331-8526. For hours of operation and
  more information see https://www.gvsu.edu/elearn/help/.
\item
  \emph{For help with the GVSU network, email, or printing}: Email the
  GVSU IT Help Desk at helpdesk@gvsu.edu; or call (616) 331-2101 or toll
  free (855) 435-7488. For hours of operation and more information see
  https://www.gvsu.edu/it/.
\item
  \emph{For specific help with your computer}: Try the GVSU IT Help Desk
  (see previous bullet) or contact your equipment manufacturer or
  computer store.
\item
  \emph{For help with course tools such as Desmos and Campuswire}: Ask a
  question on the \texttt{\#tech} channel on Campuswire, seek out the
  help documentation in the tool, or do a targeted Google search.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Deadlines and late work:} Deadlines for course work are clearly
indicated on the Course Calendar; in cases of apparent conflict between
dates, always assume that the Course Calendar is right.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{For Daily Prep and Followup Activities}: No extensions to
  deadlines are available. Simply submit a good faith effort on all
  items by the deadline.
\item
  \emph{For Checkpoints and Weekly Practice}: Deadlines may be extended
  12 and 24 hours, respectively, by spending a token. No other
  extensions are available.
\item
  \emph{For AEPs}: There is only one deadline for AEP's, namely the last
  day of classes (11:59pm ET, Friday December 11). Otherwise you simply
  submit your work when it is ready to be graded (subject to the
  Two-Item-Per-Week Rule). This deadline will not be extended.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Math Center:} GVSU's Math Tutoring Center is online with
Blackboard Collaborate this semester. You can access virtual drop-in
tutoring through a link in your Blackboard course called Math Tutoring
Center or on our website at http://gvsu.edu/tutoring/math/. Then you
need to click on the ``Online Math Tutoring Center'' button, which will
require a GVSU login. There will be tutors online, ready to help, Monday
through Thursday 10a -- 9p, Friday 10a -- 2p and Sunday 6p -- 9p
starting Wednesday, September 2nd. Bring questions about your
technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems. All Math
Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often. When you enter the
Collaborate room, please type your first and last name so you can get
you signed in and connected with a tutor.

\textbf{Special learning needs:} If you have special needs because of
learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to
contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at 616-331-2490 or
http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/ . DSR will help you arrange accommodations.
Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and
ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

\textbf{Basic needs security:} If you have difficulty affording
groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack
a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/}{Replenish}, a food resource for
GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me
about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect
you with other campus resources.

\textbf{Gender identity and expression:} If, for purposes of gender
identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match
your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please
contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's
office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and
will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in
Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

\textbf{Changes to this syllabus:} Changes to this syllabus may occur
during the semester. In those cases, the changes will be announced in
class and online, and if appropriate, students will be given a voice on
how the changes will be implemented. It is your responsibility stay
abreast of the information passed along in course announcements so that
you will be aware of any changes that take place.

\textbf{Credits:} Portions of the language of this syllabus were adapted
from the syllabi of Prof.~Matt Boelkins and Prof.~David Clark, both of
GVSU.

\hypertarget{mth-225-covid-19-policies}{%
\subsection{MTH 225 COVID-19 Policies}\label{mth-225-covid-19-policies}}

As you are well aware, we will be having class this semester while
trying to navigate a global pandemic that seems to change every day.
While we can't predict even the near future, the following are general
guidelines and plans for how we can work productively together in the
course.

\hypertarget{taking-care-of-yourself}{%
\subsubsection{Taking care of yourself}\label{taking-care-of-yourself}}

Above all else, \textbf{take care of your own physical and mental
health} during these difficult times. Make sure you are getting
sufficient rest, staying connected to friends and family, and giving
yourself time and space to do things you enjoy outside of college.
\href{https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/self-care-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic}{This
website lists several good tips} for maintaining good self-care in our
situation.

Before coming to campus, \textbf{perform a self-evaluation each time}
and \textbf{if you feel even the slightest bit of sickness or Covid-19
symptoms, stay home and participate remotely}. You should be on campus
only if you feel \emph{completely healthy}.

Remember that \textbf{at any time this semester if you feel unable or
unwilling to be present for a F2F meeting, you can opt out of the
meeting and participate remotely or asynchronously. No questions asked,
no permission needed, no penalty incurred}. Also note that \emph{there
are no graded assessments done in class} so you will never have to make
up work that was turned in during class.

\hypertarget{keeping-our-class-meetings-safe}{%
\subsubsection{Keeping our class meetings
safe}\label{keeping-our-class-meetings-safe}}

When you are present in a F2F meeting, please observe the following:

\textbf{Wear a mask at all times.} Face coverings, such as masks, are
required to be worn in the classroom. Students who have forgotten their
face coverings may get a disposable mask at a campus office. The
evidence is clear that
\href{https://www.wbtv.com/2020/06/29/demonstration-aims-show-effectiveness-masks/}{face
coverings are a crucial part of keeping coronavirus at bay} and
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/inclusion/suggested-syllabus-language-for-inclusion-and-equity-132.htm}{support
the university's commitment to providing all members of its community
with an inclusive living and learning environment with equitable
opportunities for success}. GVSU's policy on face coverings is posted on
the
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/lakerstogether/face-covering-policy-27.htm}{Lakers
Together web site}. Students who are not able to wear a face covering
due to a medical condition should
\href{https://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/}{contact Disability Support Services
(DSR)} to discuss their individual situation.

Please note, students who remove their masks during class, wear the mask
incorrectly (for example, with the nose exposed), or refuse to wear mask
at all will be reminded of this policy once, and then asked to leave if
non-compliance continues.

\textbf{Observe proper social distancing.} Your classroom has been
specially arranged so that students are 6 feet apart from each other and
from the professor at all times. This is sufficient for social
distancing and close enough so that 2-3 students can turn to each other
and discuss a concept. We will also leverage technology to allow for
more remote communication, for example using the chat rooms in
Campuswire. \textbf{Please do not encroach on the space of another
person or share physical objects with another such as pens, calculators,
or paper.}

\textbf{Practice appropriate personal hygiene.} Wash your hands
regularly or use hand sanitizer. If you must cough or sneeze, do so
facing away from other people and use the inside of your elbow to cover
your mouth, even if you have a mask on. You may wish to bring sanitizing
wipes to wipe down your desk and seat before and after class.

If you expect any difficulties in abiding by these terms, you should
plan on exercising your options to participate in the course online.

\hypertarget{contingency-plans-for-the-semester}{%
\subsubsection{Contingency plans for the
semester}\label{contingency-plans-for-the-semester}}

We will begin the semester in ``staggered hybrid'' mode, but several
things could happen during the semester that might alter this setup. The
details for how we respond to events of the next 14 weeks depend on the
situation, but please rest assured that I (Talbert) have plans in
reserve for all likely scenarios including if the university goes fully
online or if I cannot be present due to self-quarantine or infection.
\textbf{Remember to check your email, Blackboard announcements, and
Campuswire daily to stay notified of all course information}.

\hypertarget{encouragement}{%
\subsubsection{Encouragement}\label{encouragement}}

Although these plans can be scary and demoralizing, I want you to know
that \textbf{GVSU is doing everything in its power to keep people safe
from Covid-19}. In my view, GVSU's campus is at least as safe from
Covid-19 as the average large supermarket, which many of us visit on a
regular basis now without much trepidation. Furthermore I believe that
\textbf{if we observe reasonable precautions like the ones described
here, then while the risk of Covid-19 is still present, there's no
reason to be afraid.} We will still learn and grow intellectually just
as in ``normal'' times if we stay focused and work together.

earlier. Learning Targets in group CS are assessed on the Final Exam.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Group A: Represent integers using different number bases, and
  perform integer arithmetic using different bases and modular
  arithmetic}.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
