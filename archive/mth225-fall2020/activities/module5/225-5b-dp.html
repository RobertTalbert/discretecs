<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-5b-sets-operations">Daily Preparation, Module 5B: Sets operations</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Tuesday, October 6</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort — try to be right and understand everything, but don’t get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In Module 5B, you’ll learn about <em>operations</em> on sets, so that we will be able to take two sets and turn them into a third set using something almost like arithmetic. You’ll learn about the <strong>intersection</strong>, <strong>union</strong>, <strong>Cartesian product</strong>, <strong>difference</strong>, and <strong>complement</strong> of sets as well as the <strong>power set</strong> and the <strong>cardinality</strong> of a set. We’ll take a specific look at how the different set operations combine with each other and how to visualize the results with a <strong>Venn diagram</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SF.1</strong>  <strong>(Core)</strong>: I can represent a set in roster notation and set-builder notation; determine if an object is an element of a set; and determine set relationships (equality, subset).</li>
<li><strong>SF.2</strong>: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a set, state its cardinality.</li>
<li>Given two sets, find their union, intersection, and set difference as well as the complement of each.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a finite set <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.68333em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">A</span></span></span></span></span>, list all the elements of <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(A)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 1em; vertical-align: -0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right: 0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">A</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span></span> (the power set of <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.68333em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">A</span></span></span></span></span>).</li>
<li>Given two sets, find their Cartesian product.</li>
<li>Draw accurate Venn diagrams visually representing a combination of two or three sets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Read the following from <em>Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="%5Bhttp://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html%5D(http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html)">Section 0.3</a> starting where Example 0.3.3 ends, and continuing through the end.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> These were made by me for MTH 210 (Communicating in Mathematics) but they work for MTH 225 as well. Total running time is 12:32.</p>

</ul>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on Classkick as “Module 5B Daily Prep”.</p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there’s nothing to submit – just do the work and you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
