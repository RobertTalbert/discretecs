<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, <strong>Thursday, November 19</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort — try to be right and understand everything, but don’t get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this part of Module 11, we’re going to look at a computational method for building solutions to a particular kind of recurrence relation, called a <em>linear homogeneous</em> recurrence relation. It involves swapping the recurrence relation out with a related second-degree polynomial (something that looks like <span class="katex--inline"><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><msup><mi>x</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">ax^2 + bx + c</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.897438em; vertical-align: -0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height: 0.814108em;"><span class="" style="top: -3.063em; margin-right: 0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height: 2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.77777em; vertical-align: -0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right: 0.222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height: 0.43056em; vertical-align: 0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">c</span></span></span></span></span>) and then using the quadratic formula to find its roots, then translating this back into recurrence relations. It’s called the <strong>characteristic root technique</strong> and is a foolproof, if somewhat involved, way of constructing closed-form solutions.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SR.4:</strong> I can use iteration and characteristic roots to solve a recurrence relation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>(<em>Review</em>) Find the roots of a second-degree polynomial by using the Quadratic Formula.</li>
<li>State the <em>order</em> of a recurrence relation and state what it means for a recurrence relation to be <em>linear</em> and <em>homogeneous</em>; and given a collection of recurrence relations, identify the ones that are linear, homogeneous, and either first or second order.</li>
<li>Given a first- or second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation, state its <em>characteristic polynomial</em> and find its roots.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a first- or second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation, state its <em>characteristic polynomial</em>, find its roots; if the roots are not repeated, construct a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation and check that it works.</li>
<li>Given a first- or second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation, state its <em>characteristic polynomial</em>, find its roots; if the roots <em>are</em> repeated, construct a closed-form solution for the recurrence relation and check that it works.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Video:</strong> First, here is a refresher on the quadratic formula if you need it (be honest – you might need it):</p>
<ul>
<li>How to solve quadratic equations using the quadratic formula (5:56) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlNAJl36-10">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlNAJl36-10</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, here are three videos covering the material for this module. These were made (by me) back in 2016 when we covered this material in MTH 325 instead of MTH 225.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linear homogeneous recurrence relations (2:08) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c6Bg2GJvQw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c6Bg2GJvQw</a></li>
<li>The characteristic equation and characteristic roots of recurrence relations (3:48) <a href="https://youtu.be/GvOBBcnIjlw">https://youtu.be/GvOBBcnIjlw</a></li>
<li>Solving linear homogeneous recurrence relations (5:45) <a href="https://youtu.be/Rwm-NW9Y5iM">https://youtu.be/Rwm-NW9Y5iM</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Read through <a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_recurrence.html">Section 2.4 of the Levin text</a>, <em>starting at</em> “The Characteristic Root Technique” and continuing to the end.  The interactive exercises at the end will give you some practice too.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on the following Google Form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDBhhK6ovFnH-qEsRRqVdhnRYyUAyRrGvCETwsLLukEyfOXw/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDBhhK6ovFnH-qEsRRqVdhnRYyUAyRrGvCETwsLLukEyfOXw/viewform</a></p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there’s nothing to submit – just do the work and you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
