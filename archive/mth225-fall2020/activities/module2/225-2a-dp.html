<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-2a-modular-arithmetic-and-applications-to-cryptography">Daily Preparation, Module 2A: Modular arithmetic and applications to cryptography</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Sunday, September 13</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort — try to be right and understand everything, but don’t get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In Module 2 we will look at more basic computer arithmetic, this time focusing on a special operation that doesn’t have an analogue in our usual school math background: the “modulus” or <code>%</code> operator. Like the basic arithmetic operations of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, the modulus operator takes two numbers as input and produces a third one as an output — but it does it in a special way using the <strong>Division Algorithm</strong> (something we <em>did</em> learn in elementary school) and returning a remainder after division. This operation turns out to have profound applications throughout computer science, and we’ll take a look at one such application in <strong>cryptography</strong>, the science of making and breaking coded messages. (Shout-out to all the Cybersecurity majors.)</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A.3: I can compute <code>a % b</code> given integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and perform modular arithmetic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>State the Division Algorithm and explain its notation and main points.</li>
<li>Given two integers a, n with n &gt; 0, find <code>a % n</code>.</li>
<li>Encrypt and decrypt using the shift cipher given the key.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compute <code>a % b</code> if <code>a</code> is a negative integer.</li>
<li>Encrypt and decrypt using the multiplicative cipher.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> There’s no assigned text to read this time; the videos do it all. However, as always, Google searches will turn up a <em>lot</em> of material on the web in case you are needing more help.</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> Watch the following videos. The total running time is 18:35.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Division Algorithm (6:51) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjSy_MT7u0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHjSy_MT7u0</a>  This was created by me for the class MTH 210, but it also works for MTH 225.</li>
<li>The modulus operator (1:07) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTtsX2Wg9Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrTtsX2Wg9Q</a> This video just introduces notation – it does not go into any depth. That’s what the next video does:</li>
<li>The modulus operator (10:37) This video was made by me (Talbert) and can be found in the Module 2 folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus material:</strong> This page has some nice computer science applications of the modulus operator that you may find handy, along with links to additional explanations: <a href="https://blog.mattclemente.com/2019/07/12/modulus-operator-modulo-operation.html">https://blog.mattclemente.com/2019/07/12/modulus-operator-modulo-operation.html</a></p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises for this assignment are found at Classkick this time. Go to <a href="http://app.classkick.com">http://app.classkick.com</a> and sign in (as a “Portfolio” student). If prompted, use the code Q4L W99.</p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there’s nothing to submit – just do the work and you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
