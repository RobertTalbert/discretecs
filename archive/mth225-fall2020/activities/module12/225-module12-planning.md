# Module 12 

Part A: 

- What is a proof
- Reminder of proofs we've seen -- combinatorial, proving that a function solves a RR
- On that last one: Uses the recursive nature of the RR --- requires first step, and assuming that the function "works" at one step, show that it works at the next step
- Structure of an induction argument 
- Formal principle of induction

Part B: 
- Stating the parts of an induction proof
- Analysis of an induction proof
