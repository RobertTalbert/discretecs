# Module 6 planning

## Overall: 

Functions

- **SF.3 (Core)**: I can determine whether or not a given relation is a function, determine the domain and codomain of a function, and find the image and preimage of a point using a function.
- **SF.4**: I can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.


Micro-objectives: 

+ State the definition of a function. 
+ State the domain, codomain, and range of a function.
+ Find the image of an input using a function using correct function notation. 
+ Determine whether a relationship is a function, when stated as a diagram, formula, table of outputs, or visual image. 
+ Find the composition of two functions. 
+ Determine whether a function is an injection, surjection, or bijection. 
+ Find the image and inverse image of a set under a function. 
+ Define and use the *floor* and *ceiling* functions.  

Part A: Focus on definitions, working with functions including floor and ceiling; implementation in Python; maybe composition
Part B: Focus on injection, surjection, bijection, image and inverse image of sets 


## Part A

+ State the definition of a function. 
+ Determine whether a relationship is a function, when stated as a diagram, formula, table of outputs, or visual image. 
+ State the domain, codomain, and range of a function.
+ Define and use the *floor* and *ceiling* functions.  *Maybe need video content for this*

+ Find the image of an input using a function using correct function notation. 
+ Find the composition of two functions. 


Activities: 

- In class: Determine the domain, range, and codomain given as sets. Include Python functions. For fun: Collatz conjecture. 
- Pre class: Determine which are funtions; images of points; explain difference between range and codomain 


## Part B

+ Determine whether a function is an injection, surjection, or bijection. 
+ Find the image and inverse image of a set under a function. 

Activities: 

- Look at modular exponentiation -- when is it a surjection? 
-
