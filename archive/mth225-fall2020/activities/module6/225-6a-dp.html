<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-6a-functions">Daily Preparation, Module 6A: Functions</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Sunday, October 11</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort — try to be right and understand everything, but don’t get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Module 6 is all about <strong>functions</strong> which is a somewhat familiar idea for us. We’re pretty familiar with the concept of functions through previous math work and through using Python functions – a function is just a way of taking objects in one set (the <em>domain</em> of the function) and changing them into objects in another set. The purpose of this module is to make this basic idea mathematically precise. You’ll learn about the <em>domain</em>, <em>range</em>, and <em>codomain</em> of a function, different ways of representing functions (especially when they involve different data types), the special functions <code>floor</code> and <code>ceiling</code>, and what it means to <em>compose</em> two functions.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SF.3</strong>  <strong>(Core)</strong>: I can determine whether or not a given relation is a function, determine the domain and codomain of a function, and find the image and preimage of a point using a function.</li>
<li><strong>SF.4</strong>: I can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>State the definition of a function.</li>
<li>Determine whether a relationship is a function, when stated as a diagram, formula, table of outputs, or visual image.</li>
<li>Define and use the <em>floor</em> and <em>ceiling</em> functions.</li>
<li>Find the image of an input using a function using correct function notation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>State the domain, codomain, and range of a function.</li>
<li>Find the composition of two functions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For this module, I recommend you watch the videos first and THEN read in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> These were made by me for MTH 210 (Communicating in Mathematics) but they work for MTH 225 as well.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Read the following from <em>Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html">Section 0.4</a>, read up to (but not including) the section “Surjections, Injections, and Bijections”.</li>
<li>Pay particular attention to the “two line notation” used for functions. This doesn’t appear in the videos.</li>
<li>Also, take a few minutes to think about the idea of “closed formulas” versus <em>recursively defined functions</em>. We won’t deal with recursively defined functions now, because we will be going into depth on those in Module 10. But make a note of this concept for when we get to Module 10.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on the following Google Form: <a href="https://bit.ly/34h8V7r">https://bit.ly/34h8V7r</a></p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there’s nothing to submit – just do the work and you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
