    "+ A *permutation* of a string is a rearrangement of the characters in a different order. \n",
    "+ The ordering of a permutation matters. For example the string \"LOL\" and the string \"LLO\" are considered different. \n",

    ">The Python library `itertools` has a number of great built-in functions for enumerating permutations. In particular, the function `permutations()` takes a list or a string and produces an iterable consisting of all the permutations of that list or string. The output isn't a list itself, so it's often useful to wrap it in `list()`."
