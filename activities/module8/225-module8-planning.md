# Module 8 -- combinations and permutations + combinatorial proof

A: Combinations and permutations

- Determine the number of permutations of a collection of $n$ objects
- Determine the number of $k$-permutations of $n4 objects
- State a closed formula for ${n}\choose{k}$
- Solve counting problems that involve combinations and permutations


B: Combinatorial proofs 

- Explain the concept of mathematical proof in general and combinatorial proof in particular
- Explain the steps of a given combinatorial proof
- Given a mathematical situation, make observations about it, make a conjecture, and outline a combinatorial proof.
