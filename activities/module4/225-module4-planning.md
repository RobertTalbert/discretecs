# Module 4 planning

Focus on logical equivalence, quantification, predicates. 

Learning Targets: 

  + L.2 **(Core)**: I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 
  + L.3: I can determine whether a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined, and state its negation. 

Micro targets: 

A: 
- Determine whether two statements are logically equivalent. 
- State DeMorgan's laws and use them to simplify a proposition involving negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. 
- State an implication as a disjunction. 
- State the negation of an implication. 

B:

- Define the term "predicate" and explain how a predicate is different from a proposition. 
- Identify the quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$. 
- Decide if a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined.
- State the negation of a quantified statement with one quantifier. 
- State the negation of a quantified statement with two quantifiers.
