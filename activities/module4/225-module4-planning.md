# Module 4 planning

Focus on logical equivalence, quantification, predicates. 

Learning Targets: 

  + L.2 **(Core)**: I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 
  + L.3: I can determine whether a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined, and state its negation. 

Micro targets: 

A: 
- Determine whether two statements are logically equivalent. 
- State DeMorgan's laws and use them to simplify a proposition involving negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. 
- State an implication as a disjunction. 
- State the negation of an implication. 

B:

- Define the term "predicate" and explain how a predicate is different from a proposition. 
- Identify the quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$. 
- Decide if a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined.
- State the negation of a quantified statement with one quantifier. 
- State the negation of a quantified statement with two quantifiers. 

## Part A


- Determine whether two statements are logically equivalent. 
- State DeMorgan's laws.
- Use DeMorgan's laws to simplify a proposition involving negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. 
- State an implication as a disjunction. 
- State the negation of an implication. 

In class: 
- Construct truth tables to decide if statements are LE and build logic circuits to check 
- Prove laws of symbolic logic with truth tables
- PE: Implication as disjunction, negation of implication, truth of predicates 
- 


## Part B

- Define the term "predicate" and explain how a predicate is different from a proposition. 
- Identify the quantifiers $\exists$ and $\forall$. 
- Decide if a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined.
- State the negation of a quantified statement with one quantifier. 
- State the negation of a quantified statement with two quantifiers. 

In class:

- The following predicate is always true, sometimes true, never true? State the negation

## Throwaway code/LaTeX

```python
def  foo(a,b):
	if ((not a) or (not b) or (a) or (not a)):
		print("There was an error")
	else:
		print("The program executed successfully")
```

if a or (a and b): 

```python
def  foo(a,b):
	if a or (a and b):
		print("You win!")
	else:
		print("You lose!")
```
