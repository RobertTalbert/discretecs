# Module 4 planning

Focus on logical equivalence, quantification, predicates. 

Learning Targets: 

  + L.2 **(Core)**: I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 
  + L.3: I can determine whether a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined, and state its negation. 

Micro targets: 

- Determine whether two statements are logically equivalent. 
- State DeMorgan's laws and use them to simplify a proposition involving negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. 
- State an implication as a disjunction. 
- State the negation of an implication.
