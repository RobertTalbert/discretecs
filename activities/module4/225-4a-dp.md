# MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1 

## Daily Preparation, Module 4A: Logical equivalence of propositions

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Sunday, September 27

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort --- try to be right and understand everything, but don't get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question. 



## Overview 

Module 4 continues our study of symbolic logic. In Module 4A, we will look at **logical equivalence** of propositions, where we try to determine whether two propositions that are differently phrased are true under all the same circumstances. In the process, we'll discover and prove some *laws of logic* such as **DeMorgan's Laws** which allow us to simplify logical expressions. 

## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

  + **L.2** **(Core)**: I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 
  + **L.3**: I can determine whether a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined, and state its negation. 

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- Determine whether two statements are logically equivalent using a truth table. 
- State DeMorgan's laws.
- State an implication as a disjunction. 
- State the negation of an implication. 



**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Use DeMorgan's laws to simplify a proposition involving negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. 
- Discover and prove symbolic logic laws using truth tables, and apply those laws to rewrite and simplify logical propositions. 

## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read the following from *Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction*: 

- [Section 3.1](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_propositional.html), up to starting at the section "Logical Equivalence" and continuing through to the end.

**Video:** These were made by me for MTH 210 (Communicating in Mathematics) but they work for MTH 225 as well. **I recommend watching at least the three of these.** Also **"Truth Tables Part 4" deals with statements with 3 variables rather than 2**. 

- Truth tables for conditional statements (4:56) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT1FgtoeFx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT1FgtoeFx4)
- Truth tables, Part 1 (6:07) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2yksDk4h6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2yksDk4h6s) 
- Truth tables, Part 2 (5:51) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKRryCRG4Tk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKRryCRG4Tk)
- Truth tables, Part 3 (6:16) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j0DsAWbP7E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j0DsAWbP7E)
- Truth tables, Part 4 (7:03) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GD25pbPTFs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GD25pbPTFs) 

You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.



## Exercises

The exercises for this assignment are found at Classkick. Go to http://app.classkick.com and sign in (as a "Portfolio" student). If prompted, use the code `A7Z 3LH`.


## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there's nothing to submit -- just do the work and you're good. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
