# MTH 225 Module 5 planning

## Overall 

Sets: 
- Notation
- Popular ("special") sets (natural numbers, integers, etc.) 
- Set builder vs. roster 
- Computations with sets (intersection, union, complement, etc.)
- Relationships: equality, subset
- Power set
- Cardinality
- Cartesian product
- Venn diagrams 
- Python: List comprehensions 

Learning Targets
-   SF.1  **(Core)**: I can represent a set in roster notation and set-builder notation; determine if an object is an element of a set; and determine set relationships (equality, subset).
-   SF.2: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set.
