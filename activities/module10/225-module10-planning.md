# Module 10

- Explain the difference between a closed formula for a sequence and a recursive definition for a sequence. 
- Given a closed formula for a sequence, generate the first 5-10 terms of the sequence. 
- Given a recursive definition for a sequence, generate the first 5-10 terms of the sequence. 
- State the first 5-10 terms of the *triangular numbers* and the *Fibonacci numbers*. 
- Given a sequence, generate the first 5-10 terms of its sequence of partial sums. 
- Find a closed formula for a sequence using known closed formulas for related sequences. 
- Given a sequence of numbers or visual patterns, write a recursive definition that generates the
