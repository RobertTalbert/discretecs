# Module 10

- Explain the difference between a closed formula for a sequence and a recursive definition for a sequence. 
- Given a closed formula for a sequence, generate the first 5-10 terms of the sequence. 
- Given a recursive definition for a sequence, generate the first 5-10 terms of the sequence. 
- State the first 5-10 terms of the *triangular numbers* and the *Fibonacci numbers*. 
- Given a sequence, generate the first 5-10 terms of its sequence of partial sums. 
- Find a closed formula for a sequence using known closed formulas for related sequences. 
- Given a sequence of numbers or visual patterns, write a recursive definition that generates the sequence. 
- Write a sum or product using $\sum$ and $\prod$ notation; and calculate sums and products given using these notations. 

---

- State the definition of an *arithmetic* sequence, and find the common difference of an arithmetic sequence. 
- Determine whether a given sequence is arithmetic; if it is, find closed formulas and recursive definitions for it. 
- State the definition of an *geometric* sequence, and find the common ratio of an arithmetic sequence. 
- Determine whether a given sequence is geometric; if it is, find closed formulas and recursive definitions for it. 
- Find the sum of terms in an arithmetic sequence. 
- Find the sum of terms in a geometric sequence.
