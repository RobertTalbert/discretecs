Hi again. This is the second video in a series introducing some fundamental tools and concepts for counting complex arrangements. In the previous video, we learned how to count two different-looking collections of objects: The collection of all subsets of a finite set having n elements, and the collection of all n-bit strings. We learned that the number of such objects is 2^n for both collections and this was no coincidence, since there was a bijection between the two sets that identifies each element of one collection as an element of the other. 

In this video, we're going to look at a similar but different problem: counting the number of subsets of an n-element set, that have exac
