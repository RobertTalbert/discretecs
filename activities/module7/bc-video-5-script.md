Welcome to the fifth and final video on counting complex arrangements. In the last video we made an important discovery -- that the number of k-element subsets of an n-element set is the same as the number of n-bit strings with weight k. In this video we're going to look at a third counting problem that seems totally unrelated to either of these, but see a familiar face in the results. This is going to lead us to define the all-important notion of the binomial coefficient. We'll end this video explaining what this
