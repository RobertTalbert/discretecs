- Counting the number of subsets of a set
	- Example using 3 elements then list them 
	- Example using 5 elements
	- Example in general
- How not to count the number of $k$-element subsets of a set 
	- Using the multiplicative principle and 4 elements 
	- Overcounting 
- The right way to count the number of $k$-element subsets of a set
	- Start off the "wrong" way
	- Count the number of ways to rearrange the $k$-element sets -- multiplicative principle
	- Then divide off
	- Example: 6 element subsets of a 10-element set -- compute, then use Python
- Counting bit strings of weight $k$ using recursion 
	- What "weight k" means 
	- Problem: How many n-bit strings of weight k? 
	- Notation $B_k^n$ and the cardinality of that set is the number
	- Example $B_2^4$ so the car 
	- What is $|B_
- Why counting bit strings is the same thing as counting subsets 
- The binomial coefficient
