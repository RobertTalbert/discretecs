Hello again. We're looking some more at processes for counting complex arrangements of objects. In the first two videos we learned how to count the number of subsets of a finite set, the number of bit strings of length n, and then the number of k-element subsets of an n-element set. In the last video we saw that counting these arrangements isn't always as simple as applying the additive or multiplicative principles, but that we have to beware of overcounting. 

In this video we're going to take on yet another counting problem, counting the number of bit strings that have a certain "weight". 

Specifically we are going to look at the problem of counting the number of n-bit
