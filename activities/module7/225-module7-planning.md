# Module 7

## Overall: 

First unit on counting. Learning Targets: 

-   C.1  **(Core)**: I can use the additive and multiplicative principles and the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to formulate and solve counting problems.
-   C.2: I can calculate a binomial coefficient and correctly apply the binomial coefficient to formulate and solve counting problems.


Micro-objectives: 

Module 7A: 

+ Use the Additive Principle to count the number of ways a pair of disjoint events can occur. 
+ Use the Multiplicative Principle to count the number of ways a linked pair of events can occur. 
+ State the Additive and Multiplicative Principles. 
+ Given an arrangement to count, determine whether the Additive Principle, the Multiplicative Principle, or neither applies. 
+ State the Additive and Multiplicative Principles in terms of set operations. 
+ Find the cardinality of a union of two sets. 
+ Find the cardinality of a union of three sets. 
+ Explain the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion (PIE). 

Module 7B: 

- Define the binomial coefficient ${n} \choose {k}$ in terms of: 
	- Counting $n$-bit strings of weight $k$
	- Counting $k$-element subsets 
- Explain how the binomial coefficien
- t is used to count bit strings, subsets, lattice paths,
