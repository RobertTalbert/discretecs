# Module 7

## Overall: 

First unit on counting. Learning Targets: 

-   C.1  **(Core)**: I can use the additive and multiplicative principles and the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to formulate and solve counting problems.
-   C.2: I can calculate a binomial coefficient and correctly apply the binomial coefficient to formulate and solve counting problems.


Micro-objectives: 

+ Use the Additive Principle to count the number of ways a pair of disjoint events can occur. 
+ Use the Multiplicative Principle to count the number
