Welcome to this fourth video in a series on counting complex arrangements. Previously we've learned how to count the number of subsets of a finite set and the number of bit strings with length n; and the more complex situations of k-element subsets of an n-element set and n-bit strings with weight k. At the end of the last video we teased a connection between these last two that we're going to explore now. 

So in this video, we're going to revisit an earlier idea that if I want to count a two collections of objects and I know how to count one of those collections, I can count the other by setting up a bijection between the two sets I'm counting. In this video we're going to build a bijection between the collection of k-element subsets of an n=element set and the collection of n-bit strings with weight k. Since those are both finite sets, this will show they have the exact same number of elements so the count of one set eq
