Welcome to this fourth video in a series on counting complex arrangements. Previously we've learned how to count the number of subsets of a finite set and the number of bit strings with length n; and the more complex situations of k-element subsets of an n-element set and n-bit strings with weight k. At the end of the last video we teased a connection between these last two that we're going to explore now. 

So in this vid
