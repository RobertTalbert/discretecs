<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-6b-surjective-injective-and-bijective-functions">Daily Preparation, Module 6B: Surjective, injective, and bijective functions</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, Tuesday, October 13</p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort — try to be right and understand everything, but don’t get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We’re just learned about the mathematical idea behind functions. In Module 6B we make a distinction between three different kinds of function behavior, all based on the way that inputs and outputs are paired off: <strong>surjective</strong> functions (where a function “hits” every possible point in the codomain), <strong>injective</strong> functions (where there are no “collisions” in the codomain), and <strong>bijective</strong> functions (where a function is both injective and surjective).</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SF.3</strong>  <strong>(Core)</strong>: I can determine whether or not a given relation is a function, determine the domain and codomain of a function, and find the image and preimage of a point using a function.</li>
<li><strong>SF.4</strong>: I can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether a function given as a diagram or table is an injection, surjection, or bijection.</li>
<li>Find the image and inverse image of a set under a function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether a function given as a formula or verbal rule is an injection, surjection, or bijection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>For this module, I recommend you watch the videos first and THEN read in the text.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> These were made by me for MTH 210 (Communicating in Mathematics) but they work for MTH 225 as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Injective functions (6:49) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGYaaKryZp4&amp;list=PL2419488168AE7001&amp;index=87">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGYaaKryZp4&amp;list=PL2419488168AE7001&amp;index=87</a></li>
<li>Surjective functions (9:03) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVniPMIexQE&amp;list=PL2419488168AE7001&amp;index=89">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVniPMIexQE&amp;list=PL2419488168AE7001&amp;index=89</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Text:</strong> Read the following from <em>Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In <a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-functions.html">Section 0.4</a>, start at the section “Surjections, Injections, and Bijections” and continue through the end.</li>
<li>The interactive exercises at the end are very helpful for testing your understanding. You should do them.</li>
</ul>
<p>You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on the following Google Form: <a href="https://bit.ly/2GItLnS">https://bit.ly/2GItLnS</a></p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there’s nothing to submit – just do the work and you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
