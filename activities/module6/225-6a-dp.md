# MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1 

## Daily Preparation, Module 6A: Functions

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, Sunday, October 11

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort --- try to be right and understand everything, but don't get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question. 



## Overview 

Module 6 is all about **functions** which is a somewhat familiar idea for us. We're pretty 

## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

-   **SF.1**  **(Core)**: I can represent a set in roster notation and set-builder notation; determine if an object is an element of a set; and determine set relationships (equality, subset).
-   **SF.2**: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set.

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- Given a set, state its cardinality.
- Given two sets, find their union, intersection, and set difference as well as the complement of each.

**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Given a finite set $A$, list all the elements of $P(A)$ (the power set of $A$).  
- Given two sets, find their Cartesian product. 
- Draw accurate Venn diagrams visually representing a combination of two or three sets. 

## Resources for Learning

**Text:** Read the following from *Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction*: 

- [Section 0.3]([http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-sets.html)) starting where Example 0.3.3 ends, and continuing through the end. 


**Video:** These were made by me for MTH 210 (Communicating in Mathematics) but they work for MTH 225 as well. Total running time is 12:32. 

- Sets and set operations (8:18) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiOfsWm3peE&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=64
- Cardinality (7:50) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aXwKJk8oBw&list=PL2419488168AE7001&index=67


You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.



## Exercises

The exercises are on Classkick as "Module 5B Daily Prep". 

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there's nothing to submit -- just do the work and you're good. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
