# MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1 

## Daily Preparation, Module 9A: Stars and bars 

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, **Tuesday, November 3**

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort --- try to be right and understand everything, but don't get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question. 



## Overview 

No, this module is not about drinking alcohol with celebrities. 



## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

-   **P.1:** I can analyze and write a combinatorial proof of a combinatorial identity.

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- Explain the concept of *mathematical proof* and why proofs are necessary for computer science. 


**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Do a critical analysis of a combinatorial proof and fill in missing steps and justifications for a written proof. 

## Resources for Learning

This time it's a little unusual because **you are not to do any video-watching or book reading in order to avoid spoilers**. Just go on down to the exercises. 



## Exercises

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there's nothing to submit -- just do the work and you're good. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
