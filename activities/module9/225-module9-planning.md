# Module 9

Main points: PIE, stars/bars

-   C.4: I can use the "Stars and Bars" technique to formulate and solve counting problems.

Following Levin, do stars/bars first then PIE. 

A: Stars and bars

- Explain the kinds of problems that are solved by the stars-and-bars technique. 
- Given a problem that is solved using the stars-and-bars technique, draw the stars-and-bars chart for it. 
- Given a stars-and-bars for a counting problem, state the distribution of items that goes along with it. 
- Given a counting problem, identify whether stars-and-bars applies, and if so, solve the problem. 


B: PIE
