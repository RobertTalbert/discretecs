# MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1 

## Daily Preparation, Module 11A: Solving recurrence relations

**Due by:** 11:59pm ET, **Tuesday, November 17** 

**Estimated time requirement:** About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. *If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you're not at least halfway done, DON'T work any further* --- instead, *stop and ask for help* on the `#dailyprep` channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort --- try to be right and understand everything, but don't get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question. 



## Overview 

Module 11 is focused entirely on *recurrence relations*, which we first encountered when studying the binomial coefficient (Module 7B) and studied in further detail in Module 10. We saw that a recurrence relation is a recursive way of defining a sequence of integers, and that those recursive definitions can sometimes also be written as *closed formulas* that allow us to directly compute a term of a sequence without recursion. In Module 11A, we're going to look at some techniques for coming up with closed formulas for recurrence relations and how to check to see if a closed formula actually "solves" a recurrence relation. Two specific ways are discussed here -- *telescoping* (looking at the differences between terms and seeing if a pattern emerges when we add those differences up) and *iteration* (writing out partial sums of a sequence and looking for a pattern). 



## What you will learn 

**Learning Targets addressed in this module:** 

-   **SR.3**  **(Core)**: I can find closed-form and recursive expressions for arithmetic and geometric sequences and find their sums.
-   **SR.4:** I can use iteration and characteristic roots to solve a recurrence relation.

**BEFORE** your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following: 

- Explain what it means to "solve" a recurrence relation and what a "solution" to a recurrence relation is. 
- Given a proposed solution for a recurrence relation, prove or disprove that it actually solves the recurrence relation. 


**DURING AND AFTER** your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following: 

- Given a sequence of integers, determine a recurrence relation for it; guess a solution; then prove or disprove that your guess is correct. 
- Solve a recurrence relation using the techniques of telescoping or iteration. 

## Resources for Learning

**Reading:** Read through [Section 2.4 of the Levin text](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_recurrence.html), only up through Example 2.4.5.  (Module 11B picks up with "The Characteristic Root Technique".) 

**Video:** No *required* videos this time; in fact a lot of YouTube videos on this are not great (or are well made but focus on a technique we are not covering in Module 11A) so be careful if you go searching.

## Submission, grading, and getting help 

**Submitting your work:** Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there's nothing to submit -- just do the work and you're good. 

**How this is graded:** Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of *completeness and effort*: If your submission has **all parts completed** (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and **a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given** (no responses of "I don't know" or "I didn't understand") and **the work is submitted on time**, it gets a "check". Otherwise it gets an "x". If you are stuck on an item, you're expected to ask questions and give your best effort.  

**Getting help on this assignment:** *You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others' answers.* Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.
