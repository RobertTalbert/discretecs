# Module 11

Subject: Solving recurrence relations (2.4) 

A: 

- What does it mean to "solve" a recurrence relation 
- Coming up with what you think is a closed formula
- Proving that your guess is correct 
- Iteration 

B: 

- Solving via characteristic roots 


## Part A planning

Objectives: 

- Explain what it means to "solve" a recurrence relation and what a "solution" to a recurrence relation is. 
- Given a proposed solution for a recurrence relation, prove or disprove that it actually solves the recurrence relation. 

---
- Given a sequence of integers, determine a recurrence relation for it; guess a solution; then prove or disprove that your guess is correct. 
- Solve a recurrence relation using the techniques of telescoping or iteration.
