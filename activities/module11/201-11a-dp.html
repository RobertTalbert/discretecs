<h2 id="daily-preparation-module-11a-solving-recurrence-relations">Daily Preparation, Module 11A: Solving recurrence relations</h2>
<p><strong>Due by:</strong> 11:59pm ET, <strong>Tuesday, November 17</strong></p>
<p><strong>Estimated time requirement:</strong> About 45-60 minutes for the whole assignment. <em>If you have worked on this assignment for 30 minutes and you’re not at least halfway done, DON’T work any further</em> — instead, <em>stop and ask for help</em> on the <code>#dailyprep</code> channel on CampusWire. Remember these are graded just on completeness and effort — try to be right and understand everything, but don’t get bogged down if you get stuck. Just give a good effort and move on, and ask a question.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Module 11 is focused entirely on <em>recurrence relations</em>, which we first encountered when studying the binomial coefficient (Module 7B) and studied in further detail in Module 10. We saw that a recurrence relation is a recursive way of defining a sequence of integers, and that those recursive definitions can sometimes also be written as <em>closed formulas</em> that allow us to directly compute a term of a sequence without recursion. In Module 11A, we’re going to look at some techniques for coming up with closed formulas for recurrence relations and how to check to see if a closed formula actually “solves” a recurrence relation. Two specific ways are discussed here – <em>telescoping</em> (looking at the differences between terms and seeing if a pattern emerges when we add those differences up) and <em>iteration</em> (writing out partial sums of a sequence and looking for a pattern).</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</h2>
<p><strong>Learning Targets addressed in this module:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SR.3</strong>  <strong>(Core)</strong>: I can find closed-form and recursive expressions for arithmetic and geometric sequences and find their sums.</li>
<li><strong>SR.4:</strong> I can use iteration and characteristic roots to solve a recurrence relation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BEFORE</strong> your class meeting, use the Resources for Learning (below) to learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain what it means to “solve” a recurrence relation and what a “solution” to a recurrence relation is.</li>
<li>Given a proposed solution for a recurrence relation, prove or disprove that it actually solves the recurrence relation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DURING AND AFTER</strong> your class meeting, you will learn how to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a sequence of integers, determine a recurrence relation for it; guess a solution; then prove or disprove that your guess is correct.</li>
<li>Solve a recurrence relation using the techniques of telescoping or iteration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Reading:</strong> Read through <a href="http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_recurrence.html">Section 2.4 of the Levin text</a>, only up through Example 2.4.5.  (Module 11B picks up with “The Characteristic Root Technique”.)</p>
<p><strong>Video:</strong> No <em>required</em> videos this time; in fact a lot of YouTube videos on this are not great (or are well made but focus on a technique we are not covering in Module 11A) so be careful if you go searching.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The exercises are on the following Google Form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTI6ZFuNu6F6R4kISt5ONwpu_mYRI_UjLsAW1X_PMKhtSbvQ/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTI6ZFuNu6F6R4kISt5ONwpu_mYRI_UjLsAW1X_PMKhtSbvQ/viewform</a></p>
<h2 id="submission-grading-and-getting-help">Submission, grading, and getting help</h2>
<p><strong>Submitting your work:</strong> Your work is to be done on Classkick using the link/code above. Classkick saves your work as you go, so there’s nothing to submit – just do the work and you’re good.</p>
<p><strong>How this is graded:</strong> Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of <em>completeness and effort</em>: If your submission has <strong>all parts completed</strong> (no blank entries, even if left blank accidentally) and <strong>a good-faith effort to provide a correct solution or explanation is given</strong> (no responses of “I don’t know” or “I didn’t understand”) and <strong>the work is submitted on time</strong>, it gets a “check”. Otherwise it gets an “x”. If you are stuck on an item, you’re expected to ask questions and give your best effort.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help on this assignment:</strong> <em>You may work with others on this assignment, but you may not copy each others’ answers.</em> Evidence of copying will be treated as academic dishonesty. You may also ask questions on the #dailyprep channel on CampusWire, but you may not ask simply to be given the answers; giving and receiving answers on CampusWire will be treated as academic dishonesty.</p>
