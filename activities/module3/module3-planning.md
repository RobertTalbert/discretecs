Learning Targets for Module 3: 

  + L.1: I can use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language. 
  + L.2 (Core): I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 


Module 3 micro-objectives 

- Differentiate between a statement and a non-statement. 
- Determine whether a statement is atomic or molecular; if molecular, identify the atomic statements that make it up. 
- Use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language
- State the conditions under which a conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, and negation are true. 
- Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement. 
- Determine whether a conditional statement is true. 
- State the converse and contrapositive of a conditional statement. 
- Rewrite a biconditional statement as a conjunction of two conditionals. 
- Write a truth table for a basic conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, and negation. 
- Write a truth table for a molecular statement containing 1, 2, or 3 variables. 
- Define the term *tautology*. 

(Module 4: Picks up with logical equivalence, DeMorgans Laws, predicates, quantifiers.)

3A: Focus on statements, breaking down and interpreting statements, basic forms and when they are true, working with conditionals and biconditionals. 

Basic:

- Differentiate between a statement and a non-statement. 
- Determine whether a statement is atomic or molecular; if molecular, identify the atomic statements that make it up. 
- State the conditions under which a conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, and negation are true. 
- Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement. 

Advanced:

- Use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language
- Determine whether a conditional statement is true. 
- State the converse and contrapositive of a conditional statement. 

In class activities: 

- Individual students work through exercises on English <-> logic, stating converse and contrapositive on a Google Form (collects presence) 
- Then put into groups and have students type out/write out their responses on a Jamboard, discuss in breakout groups 
- Pull back together and debrief

3B: Mostly about truth tables. 

- Rewrite a biconditional statement as a conjunction of two conditionals. 
- Write a truth table for a basic conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, and negation. 
- Write a truth table for a molecular statement containing 1, 2, or 3 variables. 
- Define the term *tautology*


- Write a truth table for a basic conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, and negation.
