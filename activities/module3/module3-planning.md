Learning Targets for Module 3: 

  + L.1: I can use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language. 
  + L.2 (Core): I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 


Module 3 micro-objectives 

- Differentiate between a statement and a non-statement. 
- Determine whether a statement is atomic or molecular; if molecular, identify the atomic statements that make it up. 
- State the conditions under which a conjunction, disjunction, conditional, biconditional, and negation are true. 
- Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement. 
- Determine whether a conditional statement is true. 
- State the converse and contrapositive of a conditional statement. 
- Rewrite a biconditional statement as a conjunction of two conditionals.
