Learning Targets for Module 3: 

  + L.1: I can use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language. 
  + L.2 (Core): I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions.

- Differentiate between a statement and a non-statement.
