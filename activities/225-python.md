# MTH 225: Python and Jupyter crash course 

As a basic tool for exploring mathematical ideas and applying them to computer science, we'll be using the **Python** programming language frequently in the course starting in week 2. You'll be learning the essentials of Python --- "just enough to be dangerous" --- and also the **Jupyter notebook** platform for running Python. ("Jupyter" is pronounced like the planet "Jupiter".) Since our coverage of Python is minimal, we will not use class time or synchronous meetings to cover it. Instead, in this assignment you'll work through some self-paced modules to learn what you need to know. 

**Learning targets:** This assignment addresses *Learning Target CS.2: I can apply computer programming and computational thinking to frame and solve mathematical and computational problems.*

There are two parts to this assignment, one involving Python and the other involving the Jupyter notebook platform. 

## Part 1: Introduction to Python

In this part, you will learn the basics of programming in Python a simple, free, and widely-used programming language that we will use as the "mathematical microscope" in this class. 

**To complete this part:**

1. Go to http://www.codeacademy.com and create a free account, or sign in with a social media or GitHub account. 
2. Then go to https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python. This is a free, self-paced entry level minicourse on Python. **Although you may be prompted to sign up for "Codeacademy Pro", you do not need to do this to take the short course, and you do not need to pay or give credit card information.** If you set up an account but cannot access the minicourse without giving payment information, please let me (Prof. Talbert) know. 
3. The minicourse is split up into 12 units, each consisting of 1-2 lessons. **Complete the first 9 units of the course**: "Python Syntax" through "Exam Statistics". (The remaining 3 units are optional; we won't use any of the material in them, in MTH 225.) When you complete a lesson, you will a checkmark go up next to that lesson, like this: https://i.imgur.com/5ySdn7g.jpg. You do not need to complete the "Projects" or "Quizzes" at the end of the lessons; in fact you can't access these unless you have paid for the Pro version of Codeacademy (which you do NOT need to do). 


**To submit your work:** When you are done with the nine units assigned above, you will just need to show me your account page at Codeacademy with all the required lessons checked off. The checkmarks on all nine units will be counted as proof of completion. You can either show me your screen in person in a F2F class meeting, show it to me on Zoom or Google Meet, or send me a screenshot (that shows your name on the screen as well as all of the checks). 

## Part 2: Jupyter notebooks and Google Colab

In this part, you will learn the basics of  **Jupyter notebooks**, a graphical browser-based platform for running Python and other languages, and **Google Colab** which is a system for running and storing Jupyter notebooks that integrates with Google Docs. 

**To complete this part:**

1. Watch this video on Google Colab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI  (Running time 3:09) 
2. Watch the following videos on Jupyter notebooks: 
    + The Jupyter Notebook environment part 1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4WXs6niloU&t=2s (6:48)
    + The Jupyter Notebook environment part 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz4UwhQs0Z8 (4:22) 
    + The Jupyter Notebook environment part 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woEVRMADIck (7:38) 
3. Work through this brief tutorial on the **Markdown** text formatting system: http://markdowntutorial.com/  Markdown is a simple system for formatting plain text (also featured in Reddit comments!). 
4. Read through the "Overview of Colaboratory Features" and "Markdown Guide" notebooks 
5. (Make a quick notebook with some code and text)
