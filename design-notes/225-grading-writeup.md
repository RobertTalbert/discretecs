# Grading system for MTH 225 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1)

## Description of graded work 

+ **Checkpoints**: There are 23 Learning Targets in the course. Ten of these are designated as **Core** learning targets; the remaining 13 are called *Supplemental* targets. These 23 targets are assessed through a sequence of **checkpoints** which are take-home assessments. Each checkpoint contains a new instance of one problem for each Learning Target that has been covered up to that point. Each problem focuses *only* on one desigated Learning Target. There will be detailed rubrics and examples of each problem given in the class on the LMS. Work on a checkpoint problem is graded check/x: A check is given if the work meets the standard for acceptable work as given by the rubric; otherwise it recevies an x. Receiving one check on a target means that the student is rated **Proficient** on that target. Two checks --- obtained by passing checkpoint work twice on different checkpoints or through other means described in the syllabus --- means the student is rated at **Mastery** on that target. 
+ **CS learning targets**: There are three big-picture oriented learning targets designated "CS". These are satisfied not through checkpoints but through a brief porftolio of work, the contents of which are described in the syllabus. 
+ **Application/Extension Problems (AEPs)**: There will be at least 8 (but probably more than 8) problem sets given that are focused on challenging applications or extensions of the basic ideas from the course. Students pick and choose from these and work on them through the semester at their own pace (however, see Revision Policy below). These are graded using the EMRN rubric. 
+ **Learning activities**: Class participation involves two kinds of activities. One is Daily Preparation, done through the Daily Prep assignments given roughly twice per week. The other is through completing the activities given in the F2F meetings of the class. Each kind of activity will be collected and graded check/x on the basis of completeness and effort. Since there are two Daiy Preps and two F2F meetings per module, there are a total of 24 of each kind of activity for a grand total of 48. 
+ **Weekly practice**: Once a week, a set of practice exercises will be posted. These will be collected and graded using the EMRN rubric. There will be at least 10 such assignments. 

## Grading system

For AEPs and Weekly Practice, "M+" means a grade of either M or E on the EMRN rubric. 


| Grade | Core Targets | Supplemental Targets | CS Targets | AEP | LA | WP | 
|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |
A | 10 Mastery | 6 Proficient, 5 Mastery | 3 | 3 E, 4 M+ | 44 | 9 M+ |
B | 10 Mastery | 5 Proficient, 4 Mastery | 3 | 1 E, 4 M+ | 39 | 8 M+ | 
C | 5 Mastery, 5 Proficient | 7 Proficient | 2 | 5 M+ | 34 | 7 M+ | 
D | 5 Proficient | 5 Proficient | (no requirement) | 2 M+ | 24 | 4 M+ | 

An "F" is given if not all of the requirements for a D are satisfied. 

## Final exam and plus/minus rules 

There will be a final exam given asynchronously during exam week. It will consist of two sections: 

+ A big-picture section with problems and questions aimed at assessing broad conceptual understanding and skill at applying basic concepts; and
+ A final round of checkpoint problems in case further learning targets need to be checked. 

The big-picture portion will be graded simply Pass/No Pass using a rubric that will be publicized when it's time. 

**Plus/minus rules:** A "plus" grade is added to the base grade if 

+ All of the requirements for a base grade are satisfied AND either the Learning Targets or AEP requirements for the next level up are also satisfied. (Note, for Learning Targets, this requires that the Core, Supplemental, *and* CS requirements be satisfied.) AND, 
+ The big-picture portion of the final exam is passed. 

A "minus" grade is added to the base grade if

+ All of the requirements for a base grade are satisfied except for one (any one, not just Learning Targets or AEP) and that one is no more than two grade levels lower; OR 
+ The big-picture portion of the final exam is not passed. 

If a requirement is not met and it is more than two grade levels lower, the penalty will be either a minus or a full letter, at the instructor's discretion.
