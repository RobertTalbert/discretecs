## By module

- Module 1: Arithmetic 
  - Given an integer in base 2, 8, 10, or 16, represent it using another base. 
  - Add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers in base 2, 8, and 16. 
  - Use two's complement to represent a negative integer in binary. 
  - State the Division Algorithm and use it to find the quotient and remainder when dividing one positive integer by another. 
  - Compute `a % b` for an integer `a` and positive integer `b`. 
- Module 2: Logic 
  - Differentiate between a proposition and a statement that isn't a proposition. 
  - Determine the truth value of a compound proposition formed by using `AND`, `OR`, or `NOT`. 
  - Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement. 
  - State the conditions under which a conditional statement is true. 
  - Given a conditional statement and the truth values of its hypothesis and conclusion, state whether the conditional statement is true or false. 
  - State the converse and contrapositive of a conditional statement. 
  - Construct a truth table for `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, and conditional statements. 
  - Construct a truth table for a compound statement involving more than one logical connective and three or more variables. 
  - Determine whether two propositions are logically equivalent by using a truth table. 
  - Explain the differences between a predicate and a proposition. 
  - Determine the domain and truth set of a predicate.
