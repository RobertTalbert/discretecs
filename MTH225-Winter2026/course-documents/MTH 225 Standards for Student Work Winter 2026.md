# Standards for Student Work in MTH 225

## About this document

**This document contains all the details of what you will be asked to do on different assessments in the course, and what constitutes "successful" work on each task**. You should consider this document to be of equal importance as the [Syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20225%20W26%20syllabus.md) and [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=9b2a2926523202503e581c5967e916af9a4fa65374715badecd45bae9588ba32%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FDetroit) in terms of guiding your progress in the course. Study it carefully and refer to it each time before submitting an assignment, to ensure you're giving your best effort. 

## Ground Rules for all work in MTH 225

Unless otherwise stated on the assignment, every assignment in MTH 225 operates under the following guidelines: 

- **Your work is evaluated mainly on the quality of your reasoning and explanations, and only somewhat on the correctness of your answers**. Whenever you submit work that has a "final answer" it must be accompanied by an explanation of how you got it and why you think it's correct. Such explanations are generally a combination of English text and math. The English used must be clearly and simply stated. Grammatical correctness is less important, but excessive errors can make an explanation unclear. Mathematical work must be logically organized and legible. **Unless the item says otherwise, a response given without explanation will be not be considered correct or a good-faith effort at correctness.**
- **The target audience for your explanations is your classmates**. Your explanation should allow a person who has the same level of training and background as you -- but who has no familiarity with the problem you are solving -- to follow your solution from beginning to end and agree with your answer, without having to do much or any extra work and without accepting anything on faith. If your explanation skips steps; or simply asserts that something is true rather than explains why; or uses language that is unclear or hard to follow; or is disorganized or illogical; or other such things, it will probably not meet the standards. 
- **Solutions to problems should generally be free of any significant errors, and you should try to submit work that is totally free of these.** The next section below goes into detail about what is considered an "error". On the other hand, minor errors are typically ignored as long as there are not too many of them. The next section explains what a "minor error" is and gives examples. 

## What is an "error" and what is a "minor error" 

The fundamental question that drives my grading is: **Does the student's work show clear and sufficient evidence that they have mastered the core concepts and processes that the assignment focuses on?** Solutions that do provide this evidence are usually successful (even if there are small things wrong with them). But solutions that include items that cast doubt on your mastery will likely not be. 

Therefore your goal in every item of work you submit for a grade is to **provide this clear and sufficient evidence that you have mastered the content**, in the form of **clear, correct, and complete solutions** as described above. 

Note that **this goes beyond simply having "right answers" or "wrong answers"**. Sometimes a wrong answer to a problem might be wrong for reasons unrelated to the core ideas of the problem, and your grasp of the core concepts is still evident. On the flip side, a solution might have a right answer but the means by which you got that right answer does not show evidence of mastery of the core concepts. And in some cases a problem may not even have a single right or wrong answer at all.

There are four main kinds of errors that often lead to solutions that are not successful. You will hear these referred to by name: 

1. **Computational errors**. This is when you simply make a mistake in computing something, like adding $5+3$ and getting $9$. 
2. **Logical errors**. This is when you draw incorrect conclusions from data. For example, if you know that there are 10 computer science majors in a class and 5 math majors, and conclude that there are $10+5=15$ students that are either math or computer science majors -- this is a logical error because it doesn't take double-majors into account. (We'll study this, as the [Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Combinatorics/Principle+of+Inclusion+and+Exclusion).)
3. **Factual errors**. This results from misstating or misusing definitions, theorems, steps of an algorithm, or parameters in a problem statement. For example, misstating a formula is a factual error, even if you perform a computation with it and the result is mathematically correct.  Or, if a problem states that there are 100 objects that need to be sorted but you mis-copy the problem and write down 10 objects instead, that's a factual error. **Many errors in MTH 225  result from incorrectly reading or copying down information. These errors are easy to avoid, simply by slowing down and double-checking your steps.**
4. **Semantic errors**. This happens when you make a statement that is grammatically correct, but the statement itself has no meaning. For example the statement "*MTH 225 is a very purple unicorn*" obeys the rules of the English language, but it makes no sense. The same is true of the statement, "*The function of the set is 3*" because the phrase "the function of the set" has no meaning (there is no such thing). Semantic errors can be hard for those learning the subject to catch before making them. They will be politely pointed out in your feedback to help you spot and correct them. 

Along with these four kinds of errors, are two levels of severity: "significant" or "minor": 

- A **significant** error is one that pertains directly to the core concepts of the problem or assignment and calls your understanding and mastery of those concepts into question. 
- A **minor** error is one that does not pertain directly to the core concepts of the problem or assignment, and your understanding and master of those concepts is still evident despite the error. 

Whether an error is significant or minor, depends a lot on context and is at my (Talbert's) discretion to decide. Any time an error happens, of any kind of level of seriousness, it will be pointed out in the feedback you receive from me, and typically you will get a chance to correct it (see ["Reattempts of Assessments" un your syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20225%20W26%20syllabus.md#reattempts-of-assessments).)

## Standards for assignments in MTH 225 

Below are the criteria that I (Talbert) use to decide whether your work us "successful", by assignment type. 

### Engagement credit items

Items that earn engagement credits are graded on the basis of completeness and effort, with the full engagement credit amount awarded when the submission is **a good-faith effort at a complete submission, and submitted prior to its deadline** and no credit awarded otherwise. This means: 

- *The item must be turned in prior to the deadline*, not after. 
- *Each part of the item must have some response*. That is, you may not skip or omit parts of the item, and the item will not receive credit if parts are skipped or omitted, even if by accident; or if work on any one part is significantly incomplete. (Although, if a part is labeled "Optional" you can skip it.)
- *Each response must be a legitimate attempt to respond correctly to the prompt*. You may not, for example, submit "I don't know" as a response to a short-answer or long-form text question; or submit an emoji or randomly generated text. Items containing such responses will not receive credit. 

These criteria do not apply to class attendance. You will earn 1 engagement credit for attending a class meeting (other than an exam, reattempt session, or makeup session) for at least 30 minutes. 

### Application/Analysis Exams 

As explained in the Syllabus, the two Application/Analysis Exams will consist of four parts: A multiple-choice and true/false portion, and three groups of problems (where in each group you will select one problem to work from several offered). 

Application/Analysis Exams are graded **holistically**, which means that while individual items will be given feedback, the grade is given to the overall work on the exam. 

| Mark         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| *Master*     | Roughly 9/10 of the multiple choice and true/false items are correctly answered. The work from problem groups is done with no "significant" errors and no more than 3-5 "minor" errors overall                                                |     |
| *Proficient* | Roughly 7/10 of the multiple choice and true/false items are correctly answered. The work from problem groups contains no more than 3-5 "minor" errors overall, and no more than one of the problem groups can contain a "significant" error. |     |
| *Beginner*   | The criteria for *Proficient* are not met; or, if one or more Problem Groups have no significant attempts at a solution.                                                                                                                      |     |

The individual parts of each exam will also be marked and recorded on Blackboard to help you know which portions need to be reattempted later. But only the holistic, overall mark is considered for your course grade. 


### Learning Targets

As explained in the Syllabus, each Learning Target exam consists of one problem for each individual Learning Target that has been covered in the class up to that point. Each problem focuses *only* on the Learning Target it corresponds to. Subsequent exams will feature different versions of the same problems with the specific details changed. 

Below is a list of each Learning Target, what you can expect to be asked to do on its exam problem, and what constitutes a *Master* rating. A *Proficient* rating will be given for work that is mostly *Master* level but which has a few significant errors. A *Beginner* rating will be given for work that has more than a few significant errors. 


| Learning Target | Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | *Master* means...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

For logical equivalence, truth tables must hold to the same standard as above, and there must be a clear and correct statement of whether the propositions are logically equivalent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6               | Given 2-4 sets given in a mix of roster and set-builder notation: Rewrite each set in the other notation, and correctly mark a sequence of statements about set elements and subsets as True or False.                                                                                                                                                                   | When converting from set-builder to roster notation, (1) infinite and finite sets must be appropriately notated (with or without $\dots$ as appropriate), (2) at least five elements must be explicitly listed (if the set has fewer than 5 elements, all of them must be listed), and (3) all listed elements must be correct. When converting from roster to set-builder notation, the syntax of the set must be correct, and the predicate used cannot be trivial, for example $A = \lbrace x \ : \ x \in A \rbrace$. Up to one incorrect True/False response is allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 7               | Given 2-4 sets in various notations, compute combinations of intersection, union, difference, Cartesian product, and complement and state their cardinalities. Also write out the power set of a small finite set.                                                                                                                                                       | All responses should be correct and written in correct set notation. Cartesian product elements must be represented as ordered pairs (tuples) and not as sets. Up to 2 "minor" errors are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 8               | Given 2-4 mappings between sets presented in different forms (as tables, as formulas, as diagrams, as Python dictionaries, etc.) determine whether each mapping is a function or not; for those that are functions, state whether the function is injective, state whether the function is surjective, and state whether the function is bijective.                      | All determinations of whether a mapping is a function are correct. Each one that is a function must have an indication of whether it is injective, whether it is surjective, and whether it is bijective and these must be correct (no explanation required).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9               | Given a mathematical proposition that is to be proved by mathematical induction: State the predicate involved in the proposition; state the value of the variable that corresponds to the base case; prove the base case; state the inductive hypothesis; and state the inductive step. (A completed proof is not necessary and will never be asked for.)                | The predicate, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step must be correct and given in the same terms as the proposition. The base case must be fully proven with a brief but complete explanation. The following are considered to be minor errors and you are allowed at most one of these: Stating the wrong value of the variable for the base case (assuming that the base case holds with that wrong value; otherwise this is a significant error), not putting the words "Assume that.." or "Suppose that..." at the beginning of the inductive hypothesis, including a quantifier with the predicate when asked for the predicate, and using a universal quantifier instead of existential in the inductive hypothesis ("For all integers $k$" instead of "For some integer $k$).                                                                           |
| 10              | Given 1-3 simple counting situations (described as "word problems"), solve each problem using an appropriate combination of the Additive Principle, Multiplicative Principle, and Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion.                                                                                                                                                  | The solution approach must be valid (i.e. do not use the Additive Principle when the Multiplicative Principle is called for). Each solution must be clearly written out, with all steps shown and verbal explanations provided to make it clear you understand the concepts. Up to 1-2 "minor" errors are allowed. **None of the answers should be in scientific notation -- all of the digits of the answer must be visible.**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 11              | Compute a specific value of a binomial coefficient (for example $\binom{15}{8}$) using the closed formula or using a proven fact about binomial coefficients. Then given 1-2 simple counting situations involving rearrangements, solve the problem using an appropriate combination of the binomial coefficient, permutations, and $k$-permutations.                    | The computation of the binomial coefficient must be correct and show at least the setup for the closed formula, or a verbal explanation that makes sense. **Simply stating the closed formula without explicitly applying it to specific inputs will result in a grade less than Master.** For the simple counting problems, the solution approach must be valid (i.e. do not use permutations when combinations are called for). Each solution must be clearly written out, with all steps shown and verbal explanations provided to make it clear you understand the concepts. Up to 1-2 "minor" errors are allowed. Note, some simple problems may also involve applications of the Additive, Multiplicative, and Inclusion-Exclusion Principles. **None of the answers should be in scientific notation -- all of the digits of the answer must be visible.** |
| 12              | Given 3-4 sequences of numbers (written as numerical lists, for example $2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \dots$) decide whether each sequence is geometric, arithmetic, or neither; for those that are geometric or arithmetic, state both a recurrence relation (with initial condition) and a closed formula for the sequence, with the assumption that the sequence is zero-indexed. | Each determination of arithmetic, geometric, or "neither" must be correct. The recurrence relations must include an initial condition with the value of the index being zero, and a recurrence relation that correctly produces the sequence. The closed formulas must produce the correct values of the sequence assuming the initial input is zero. Up to 1-2 "minor" errors are allowed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
