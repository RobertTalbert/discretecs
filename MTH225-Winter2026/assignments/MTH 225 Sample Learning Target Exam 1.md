# MTH 225 Sample Learning Target Exam 

This is a SAMPLE Learning Target that is similar to your first one, coming on Wednesday February 4. Some things to notice: 

- There is one problem per Learning Target covered in the class so far. For Learning Target Exam 1, these are Learning Targets 1-4. The full list of Learning Targets is at the end of [the course syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20225%20W26%20syllabus.md). 
- Each problem is graded separately, either "Master" or "Proficient" or "Beginner". The exam as a whole does not have a grade; it is just a container for the problems. 
- The standards for what earns each mark, are given in the [Standards for Student Work](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20225%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%202026.md). 
- You are not required to attempt every problem. If there is a problem you believe you're not prepared to attempt, you can skip it this time and try it again at the next Learning Target exam. The next one will contain new versions of all previous problems, plus new problems for any new Learning Targets. However, due to the limited number of attempts, skipping problems is not recommended.

## Learning Target 1

>(CORE) I can find the quotient and remainder when dividing one positive integer by another using the Division Algorithm, use the modulus (%) operator to find the value of an integer modulo another, and perform modular arithmetic.

1. Use long division to find the quotient and remainder obtained when dividing 78294 by 22.
2. State the value of the following: 
    (a) `1234 % 12`
    (b) `345234523491 % 10` 
    (c) `8675309 % 5`
3. State at least five different integers that are congruent to 3 modulo 10, including at least one negative integer. 
4. Compute $2^9 \pmod{8}$. 


## Learning Target 2

>I can represent a positive integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16 and convert from base 10 using the Base Conversion Algorithm.

1. Convert the integer 42B from hexadecimal (base 16) to decimal (base 10).
2. Convert the integer 11101111 from binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10).
3. Convert the integer 445 from decimal (base 10) to binary (base 2).
4. Convert the integer 9999 from decimal (base 10) to octal (base 8). 

## Learning Target 3 

>I can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on base 2 (binary) integers.

1. Compute 101111 + 101011.
2. Compute 10101 - 10011.
3. Compute 11001 × 110.
4. Compute 1100111 ÷ 11.

Be sure to show all work, including borrowing and carrying operations, and do not simply convert to base 10. 


## Learning Target 4 

>(CORE) I can state the hypothesis, conclusion, converse, contrapositive, and negation of a conditional statement.

Consider the conditional statement: *Classes will be cancelled if the roads are poor.* 

1. State the hypothesis and conclusion of this statement. Clearly indicate which is which. 
2. State the converse of this statement. 
3. State the contrapositive of this statement. 
4. State the negation of this statement.
