00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,533
In the last video we saw a number of operations we can perform on sets to produce new sets that fit different kinds of real 

2
00:00:07,533 --> 00:00:16,266
situations. In this video we're going to introduce another set operation that's similar to these, but it's different and needs a little more explanation.
 

3
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:24,199
Let's go back to our fictitious discrete math class. Suppose the class has met a total of 10 times and instructor wants to look at attedance 

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:30,766
at class meetings. So she creates a spreadsheet with the names of students in one column and the number of days they have 

5
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:39,799
attended in the other. This pairs off each student with a number. We can think of these pairs as an ordered pair, like this. Remember 

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:49,000
that U was the set of all students in the class. And the numbers here could range between 0 and 10 since the class has met 10 times. Let's 

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,333
let A be the set 0, 1, 2, and so on through 10. The set of all possible pairs that the instructor could create, with students in the first slot of 

8
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:08,333
each pair and integers 0 through 10 in the second slot, created is called the Cartesian product of U and A. 
 

9
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:18,833
In general given any two sets A and B, the Cartesian product of A and B is the set of all ordered pairs that have the first item in the pair 

10
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:27,399
coming from A and the second item coming from B. We use a cross, like you might see in primary school to denote multiplication of two 

11
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,333
numbers, as the notation. 
 

12
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:41,966
For example, look at the set {1,2,3} product with the set {a,b}. This is the set of all ordered pairs whose first "coordinate" is in the set 1,2,3 

13
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:51,599
and whose second coordinate is in the set a,b. There are six such pairs and here they are: There are two pairs for each of the three 

14
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:01,200
elements of the set {1,2,3} -- (1,a) and (1,b), then (2,a) and (2,b), and finally (3,a) and (3,b). 
 

15
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:11,333
In our classroom example, the product of U and {0,1,2,...,10} is the set of all possible pairings of students and attendance. So there are 11 

16
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:19,633
possible pairs for each student, making this a pretty large set. The pairs that are in the instructors spreadsheet would be a subset of 

17
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:25,066
the entire product but not equal to it. 
 

18
00:02:25,066 --> 00:02:36,332
Now you try it. Write out the set A times B, where A is {x,y} and B is the set {1,2,3,4}. 
 

19
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:43,899
You should find there are eight pairs in this product, and here they are --- four pairs for each element of A. Or another way to think 

20
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,866
about it, you have two pairs for each element of B. 
 

21
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:56,899
Notice that unlike in multiplication of real numbers, the order of A and B in A times B matters. In this example you just worked, B 

22
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:06,600
times A would be this set -- it's still eight pairs and the ordering of the coordinates is reversed. But these are *ordered* pairs --- (x,1) is not 

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:15,366
considered to be the same thing as (1,x) so these two sets have the same cardinality, but the elements themselves are not 

24
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,132
the same. 
 

25
00:03:17,133 --> 00:03:23,666
You've actualy worked with Cartesian products before because you've worked with ordered pairs before. Back in your early algebra 

26
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:32,499
classes, you learned how to plot points in a two-dimensional xy-plane and then graph functions using this process. Each point is a pair of 

27
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:44,833
numbers, like (4,3) or (-2,-3). So the xy-plane which consists of **all** those points, is the set R times R where R is the set of all real 

28
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:51,866
numbers. This is the set consisting of all possible pairs with real numbers in each coordinate. 
 

29
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:58,966
So you've learned what the Cartesian product is, and how to find the Cartesian product of simple sets. In our next video, we'll be shifting 

30
00:03:58,966 --> 00:04:05,999
gears to focus on the idea of a *function* which, as we just mentioned, is a way of mapping elements of one set onto the 

31
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,800
elements of another.
