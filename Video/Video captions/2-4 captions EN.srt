00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,400
In the previous video we introduced conditional statements, often in the form "If A, then B" where A and B are propositions. This makes a 

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,400
new proposition, which is true in all cases except when the condition, or hypothesis, is met but the conclusion does not follow. 

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,766
Conditional statements are so common that it's worthwhile to look at some variations on this idea, which we'll do now. 
 

4
00:00:24,766 --> 00:00:29,532
There are three statements that commonly get formed from a conditional statement. 

5
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:34,366
Let's start with a basic conditional statement, "If P, then Q". 
 

6
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:43,732
First, we have the _converse_ of this statement which is "If Q, then P". The converse of a conditional statement in other words is the 

7
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:51,499
statement you get when you switch the hypothesis and conclusion. For example if the original statement is "If it's raining, then it's 

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,066
cloudy" then the converse is "If it's cloudy, then it's raining". 
 

9
00:00:56,066 --> 00:01:05,766
Next we have the _contrapositive_ of the statement which states "If not Q, then not P." The contrapositive is like the converse except 

10
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:14,232
we not only switch the hypothesis and conclusion but also negate each of them. If the original statement is "If it's raining, then it's 

11
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:21,199
cloudy" then the contrapositive is "If it's not cloudy, then it's not raining". 
 

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:30,066
Finally we have a lesser-known variation called the _inverse_ of the statement which goes "If not P then not Q". The inverse is like the 

13
00:01:30,066 --> 00:01:38,599
contrapositive except we do not switch the hypothesis and conclusion, just negate each one. If the original statement is "If it's raining, 

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,500
then it's cloudy" then the inverse is "If it's not raining, then it's not cloudy". 
 

15
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:52,066
Practice this for a minute using the example from the last video: "If you clean your room, then we'll get ice cream." Pause the video and 

16
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:59,032
write out the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of this statement. 
 

17
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:01,499
And here are the results! 
 

18
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,433
So, why bother with these? Mostly it's because the precise structure of these conditional statements is important, and the truth value 

19
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:17,399
can change if we change the structure. Look at the example of "If it's raining, then it's cloudy". This seems like a true conditional statement 

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,900
based on our experiences. What about the truth values of the others? 
 

21
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:29,800
The converse says "If it's cloudy, then it's raining". This is definitely NOT always the case, because it can be cloudy without it raining. Ask 

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:37,666
anybody who lives in England. So the converse of a statement is not the same thing as the original statement -- they can have opposite 

23
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:46,899
truth values. So you have to be careful to situate the hypothesis and conclusion properly and not pretend they are interchangeable. 

24
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:54,633
The contrapositive says "If it's not cloudy, then it's not raining". Now this seems true as well. Does this mean that a statement and its 

25
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:58,866
contrapositive say the same thing in different ways? 

26
00:02:58,866 --> 00:03:05,132
We can't tell based on one example, but we'll be looking at that question in another video soon. 
 

27
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:13,333
The inverse says "If it's not raining then it's not cloudy" This seems false, in fact it sounds almost like the converse. So first of all the 

28
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:22,999
inverse, like the converse, does not have the same truth value as the original --- so again, beware of the structure. But also, actually if you 

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,266
look at it, the inverse is what you get when you form the contrapositive of the converse. So in one way of thinking about it, we don't need to 

30
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:39,266
talk about the inverse, just converse and contrapositive. And it makes it all the more important that we think carefully about this 

31
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:42,732
contrapositive idea and whether taking a statement and 

32
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:51,433
forming its contrapositive is just rephrasing the original conditional statement in a superficially different way. 
 

33
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:57,233
In this video, you learned about three logical constructions related to a conditional statement: the converse, the contrapositive, 

34
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:03,999
and the inverse. ANd you learned that the converse and inverse can sometimes have different truth values than the original, while the 

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,866
contrapositive seems like it might be just a rephrasing of the original. We need something more solid about that last point, so in the next 

36
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:21,566
video we're going to come back to the idea of a truth table to help us know when two statements might be logically equivalent.
