1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,833
Now that we've learned about sets and taken a good look at set membership, we can introduce two ways of comparing sets in terms of the 

2
00:00:06,833 --> 00:00:09,233
elements that they have in common. 
 

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:17,299
Let's suppose we have a set consisting of the names of all the students enrolled in a discrete math class. The professor for that class might 

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,733
need to send a message out, not to the entire class but just to the first-year students to remind them to go see their advisors. The 

5
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:33,233
group of interest is a portion, but not all of the names in the class. Every person in that group is in the class; but we only want to send the 

6
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:42,799
message to them, not to everyone. In that case what we are using is called a **subset** of the set of all names of students in the class. This 

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,266
group of first-year students isn't the only subset of the class; we could send messages to all the graduating seniors; or all the students whose 

8
00:00:50,266 --> 00:00:56,499
first names begin with a "G"; or all the students who were sitting together at a table on Monday. 
 

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:08,933
Generally speaking, if A and B are sets, then A is a **subset of B** if every element of A is also an element of B. We use this notation, which 

10
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:23,199
looks a little like "less than or equal to" except it's rounded, to indicate A is a subset of B. So for example {1,2,3} is a subset of {1,2,3,4}. And 

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:34,866
so is {2,4}. And even the set {1,2,3,4} itself is a subset of {1,2,3,4} because every element of the set on the left is an element of the set on 

12
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:41,199
the right. This means that *every set is a subset of itself*. 
 

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,366
Another example would be the natural numbers, which are a subset of the integers because every natural number is an integer; 

14
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:57,066
and the integers are a subset of the real numbers because every integer can be located on the number line. That chain of subset 

15
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:05,032
relations means that the natural numbers are a subset of the real numbers too. The real numbers can have finite subsets as well, for 

16
00:02:05,033 --> 00:02:10,799
example the set {pi, square root of 2} is a 2-element subset of the real numbers. 
 

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:21,066
On the other hand, the set {1,5} is NOT a subset of {1,2,3,4} because *not every* element in {1,5} is an element of {1, 2, 3, 4}. 

18
00:02:21,066 --> 00:02:28,399
We can see that 5, although it's an element of {1,5} is not an element of {1,2,3,4}. 
 

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:39,100
Now you try it. Here's a set {M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S} (the different letters used in the word "mathematics"). Which of the following sets are 

20
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:45,800
subsets of this? Take a moment and identify them then come back. 
 

21
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:54,133
Here are your correct answers. The first two sets {A}, and {A,M} are subsets because every element in each one is also an element in the 

22
00:02:54,133 --> 00:03:04,633
set we started with. {A,G} is not, because the letter G is not found in the original set. And the last one is the same as the original set, and 

23
00:03:04,633 --> 00:03:09,533
we've alread explained that every set is a subset of itself. 
 

24
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:17,399
You might have noticed that we can think about subsets using quantifiers, which we learned in Module 2. The definition of subset says that A 

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:30,333
is a subset of B if every element of A is also an element of B. IN quantifier language that would say that for all x in A, x is in B. This helps us 

26
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:40,433
think about what it means for a set NOT to be a subset of somethign else. The negation of for all x in A, x in B is the statement there exists an 

27
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:53,499
x in A such that x is not in B. That's why {A,G} was not a subset of {M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S} --- because there exists an element in {A,G} 

28
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,000
(namely G) that is not in {M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S}. 
 

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:09,633
Here's another question for you: Is the empty set a subset of {M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S}? Pause the video and think about this, and come back 

30
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:14,066
when you've decided yes or no. 
 

31
00:04:14,066 --> 00:04:23,199
This one takes some careful reasoning. We can think of subsets in terms of conditional statements. The statement "for all x in A, x is in 

32
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:35,066
B" can be rephrased as the conditional statement "if x is in A then x is in B." So look at the proposition "the empty set is a subset of 

33
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:45,766
{M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S}". As a conditional statement this would say "if x is in the empty set, then x is in {M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S}". Well, the empty set is 

34
00:04:45,766 --> 00:04:55,866
empty, so the hypothesis of that statement "x is in the empty set" is always false. And when the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false, 

35
00:04:55,866 --> 00:05:07,899
the conditional statement itself is true. So believe it or not, "if x is in the empty set, then x is in {M,A,T,H,E,I,C,S}" is true, and therefore 

36
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:17,366
the empty set is a subset of this set. In fact by this reasoning, the empty is a subset of **every** set. 
 

37
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:24,932
In addition to subset relations, we can talk about whether two sets are "equal". Two sets are equal if they contain exactly the same 

38
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:33,166
elements, like {1,2,3} and {3,2,1}. These are equal sets because they have the same elements --- the ordering doesn't make them 

39
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:42,232
different. But it can be hard to tell sometimes if two sets have the same elements. For example, is the set {1,-1} equal to the set 

40
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:53,799
{x in R : x**2 = 1}? One is a finite set and the other is in set-builder notation --- it's hard to tell if the two sets have the same elements just by 

41
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:09,033
looking. So we will say that the set A and the set B are equal if A is a subset of B *and* B is a subset of A. 
 

42
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:27,066
For example, A = {1,-1} is equal to the set B = {x in R : x**2 = 1}. Here's an explanation. First, A is a subset of B because if x is in A, then x is 

43
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:41,032
either 1 or -1. And in each case, x^2  = 1, therefore x passes the filter given by the predicate in the second set, and x is in B. That 

44
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:56,299
makes A a subset of B. Likewise if y is in B, then y^2 is 1, and a little algebra shows that y^2 - 1 = 0, so (y+1)(y-1) = 0, which means 

45
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:09,366
either y = 1 or y = -1. Therefore the y that was in B, is also in A. That makes B a subset of A. Since they are subsets of each other, they're 

46
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:12,332
equal. 
 

47
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:19,199
In this video you learned what it means for a set to be a subset of another set, and what it means for two sets to be equal. Those are 

48
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:23,100
basic tools for comparing sets. See you in the next video.
