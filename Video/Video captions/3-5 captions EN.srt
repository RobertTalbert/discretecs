00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:07,566
This video is going to touch on two quick concepts related to sets that will pave the way for some of the other work we will do with them 

2
00:00:07,566 --> 00:00:10,799
in future videos. Here's the first concept. 
 

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:22,066
In the last video we talked at length about subsets of a set. For example we saw that {1,2,3} is a subset of {1,2,3,4} and so is {2,4}, 

4
00:00:22,066 --> 00:00:32,932
so is {1,2,3,4} itself, and so is even the empty set. It might make you wonder, what are all the subsets of {1,2,3,4} and how many are there? 

5
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:39,666
It's sometimes useful to think about all the possible subsets of a given set, so let's do that with this example. 
 

6
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:50,199
Well, the empty set is a subset of all sets. There are four one-element subsets of {1,2,3,4} and here those are. The number of 2-element 

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:01:01,533
subsets takes a little more work to enumerate but you would have {1,2}, {1,3} and {1,4}, then {2,3} and {2,4} --- notice {2,1} is the same as 

8
00:01:01,533 --> 00:01:12,733
{1,2} and {2,2} is the same as just {2}, and since those are already listed we leave them out. We'd also have {3,4}, and that's all the 

9
00:01:12,733 --> 00:01:24,466
two-element subsets -- six in all.  Then for the three-element subsets we have {1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, ad {2,3,4}. Then finally we have 

10
00:01:24,466 --> 00:01:31,832
{1,2,3,4} itself. That's all of them and that's 16 in all. 
 

11
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:41,799
We mentioned earlier too that sets can contain elements that are also sets, just like boxes can contain other boxes. If we take all 16 of those 

12
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:53,666
sets and put them into a set like so, we have formed the set of all subsets of {1,2,3,4}. This is a construction known as the **power set** of 

13
00:01:53,666 --> 00:02:06,366
{1,2,3,4}. The power set of a set A, is a set whose elements are all the subsets of A. And we use a script or boldface P around the set to 

14
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,866
denote it. 
 

15
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:19,099
For example, the power set of {a,b} is the set, whose elements are the subsets of {a,b}. There are four of those: the empty set, the 

16
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:33,033
one-element sets {a} and {b}, and the set {a,b}. YOu try it with the three-element set {x,y,z}. What is the power set of this set? 
 

17
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:42,599
You should find there are eight subsets for this set. The empty set is one, then these three one-element sets, then these three two-element 

18
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,666
sets, then finally the full set itself. The power set is the set containing all of those. 
 

19
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:55,866
We can form the power set of any set at all, although we may not be able to list all the elements. For example the power set of the 

20
00:02:55,866 --> 00:03:04,099
natural numbers contains all possible subsets of the natural numbers, and that's an infinite set. What about the power set of the empty 

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:09,733
set? Well, there is only one subset of the empty set, and that's the empty set itself. 

22
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:17,533
So the power set of the empty set, is the set, containing the empty set. 
 

23
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:25,866
We seem to be talking a lot about *size* here, in terms of how many elements a set has. The term **cardinality** refers to how many 

24
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:36,732
elements are in a set.  We put absolute value signs around the set to indicate its cardinality The cardinality of {x,y,z} for example is 3. The 

25
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:49,566
cardinality of the power set of {x,y,z} is 8. The cardinality of the empty set is 0 because there are no elements at all in the empty set. 
 

26
00:03:49,566 --> 00:03:59,132
If the set is finite, its cardinality is just the number of elements it has. If the set is infinite, it gets complicated. For now we will just say 

27
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:04,399
that an infinite set has infinite cardinality. But again -- it's complicated. 
 

28
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:13,233
TO see why it's complicated, look at the set of natural numbers and the set of even natural numbers. IT seems like the set of natural 

29
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:21,199
numbers should be twice as big as the set of even natural numbers. But as you can see, we can put the even natural numbers in 

30
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:29,766
one-to-one correspondence with the full set of natural numbers, so if you look at it that way, these two sets have the same number of 

31
00:04:29,766 --> 00:04:39,232
elements. So with infinite sets, we need to be more careful about talking about cardinality. For now, we'll oversimplify things and just say that 

32
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:43,133
infinite sets have infinite cardinality. 
 

33
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:52,266
So in this video you learn about the power set of a set, which is the set whose elements are all the possible subsets of the given set -- and 

34
00:04:52,266 --> 00:04:58,232
about the cardinality of a set, which roughly refers to the number of elements it has, although things get weird when the set is 

35
00:04:58,233 --> 00:05:04,533
infinite. Next up, we'll be learning about forming new sets from old ones by using set operations.
