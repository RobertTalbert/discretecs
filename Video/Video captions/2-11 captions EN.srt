00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
You've done a lot of work so far with predicates. You've learned what they are and how they related to propositions, how to 

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:14,800
quantify them, how to negate them, and more! Great job so far. But there's one question left to think about -- what happens when your 

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,633
predicate has more than just one variable?
 

4
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:30,233
Let's let P(x,y) is the statement x*y is bigger than or equal to 0. To determine the truth value of this, we need the values of not just one but 

5
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:43,366
two inputs. For example P(2,3) is true and P(2,-4) is false. We saw in the last two videos that quantifying the variable turns a predicate 

6
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:49,999
into a proposition with a definite truth value. Does that work for two-variable predicates? 
 

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:00,633
Let's suppose we took P(x,y) and quantified the variable x by saying "for all x, P(x,y) is true". Unlike earlier, this is still an underdetermined 

8
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:10,699
statement because we've quantified the x variable but the y variable is still unknown. Quantifying the x variable turns a two-variable 

9
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:18,633
predicate with variables x,y into a one-variable predicate with variable y. It's still a predicate and unless we do something with the y variable 

10
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:27,466
too, we still can't determine its truth value. The general principle here is that for two variable predicates, *both* variables must be quantified 

11
00:01:27,466 --> 00:01:32,199
before we can say anything definite about truth values. 
 

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:41,666
Let's keep the universal quantifier here on x. There are two ways to quantify the missing variable y --- universal or existential. If we 

13
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:54,732
universally quantify y, we would have this in notation --- for all x and for all y, P(x,y) is true. In plain language this would say that x*y is 

14
00:01:54,733 --> 00:02:03,866
positive for every possible pair of inputs x and y. Now this statement has a definite truth value, namely FALSE because I can find a 

15
00:02:03,866 --> 00:02:15,566
counterexample easily, for instance x = 2 and y = -4. So it's not the case that P(x,y) is true "for all" values of x and y. 
 

16
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:27,232
But we could also have existentially quantified y, to get this: for all x, there exists a y such that P(x,y) is true. Or in plain language, for every 

17
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:38,599
real number x, there is some other real number y such that x*y is positive. That statement also has a definite truth value, namely TRUE. Let's 

18
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:47,000
see why. Where you are sitting right now, pick any real number you like. Now no matter what number you picked, one of three things must 

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,700
be true about it: It's either negative, positive or zero. I will now tell you the "y" value that will make xy bigger than or equal to zero. If your "x" 

20
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:15,733
was positive or zero, let y = +1. Then x times 1 is positive or zero, which means P(x,1) is true no matter what the choice for x was. 

21
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:30,633
If your x was negative, let y = -1. Since x is negative, x times -1 is positive so P(x,-1) is true. Therefore for every x you might choose, 

22
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:39,533
no matter its value, I can find a y value --- there exists a y value -- that makes P(x,y) true. 
 

23
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:47,399
What would happen if we had existentially quantified the x earlier instead of universally quantifying it? Well, we'd still need to quantify 

24
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:55,400
the y variable to end up with a fully determined proposition and there are two ways to do that. You could have: "There exists an x such that 

25
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:06,766
for every y, P(x,y) is true" and you could have "There exists an x such and there exists a y such that P(x,y) is true". Now pause the video 

26
00:04:06,766 --> 00:04:14,266
and see if you can determine which, if either, of those statements is now true.
 

27
00:04:14,266 --> 00:04:23,566
"There exists an x such that for every y, P(x,y) is true" is in fact a true statement. The statement is claiming that at least one x exists 

28
00:04:23,566 --> 00:04:33,499
such that x*y >= 0 no matter what y you choose, and that's true --- can you guess what x it is? 

29
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:44,500
It's x = 0. If you choose that x, then xy >= 0 for every single y value. 
 

30
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,933
"There exists an x such and there exists a y such that P(x,y) is true" is also a true statement because I can certainly find an example of x 

31
00:04:51,933 --> 00:05:01,399
and y where xy >= 0, for example x = 1 and y = 2. 
 

32
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:10,100
So given a two-variable predicate P(x,y) there are at least four possible ways to quantify it: one for each combination of quantification of x 

33
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:21,833
and y. Each has its own truth value that it's our job, as mathematicians, to explain why the truth value is true or why it's false. 
 

34
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:30,799
I say "at least" four truth values because in fact sometimes the ordering of the variables matters too. For example look at the predicate 

35
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:42,833
Q(x,y) is the statement that x*y < 1 where the x values are integers and the y values are nonzero real numbers. Look at the statements 

36
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:53,399
for all x there exists a y such that Q(x,y) and there exists a y such that for all x Q(x,y). You might think these statements are equivalent 

37
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,300
since all we did was change the ordering of the quantifiers. But look at each one. 
 

38
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:09,866
The statement for all x there exists a y such that xy < 1 is TRUE, and here's an explanation. Choose any integer x you like. If you chose an 

39
00:06:09,866 --> 00:06:28,199
x that was zero or negative, set y = 1 and then xy < 1. If you chose an x that was positive, set y = 1/(x+1). Then xy is x/(x+1) and because the 

40
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:37,433
denominator is bigger than the numerator, the fraction is less than 1. That explanation, notice, does not depend on specific examples --- it 

41
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:40,266
works "for all" x. 
 

42
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:52,166
However the statement that there exists a y such that for all x, xy < 1... is a FALSE statement. I will explain why no such y exists. 

43
00:06:52,166 --> 00:07:03,432
Suppose that we did have a y such that xy < 1 no matter what the x is. This y can't be 0 because 0 isn't in the domain. Given that fact, 

44
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:21,199
it's not the case that xy < 1 "for all" values of x, because there's a counterexample: x = 1/y. If x = 1/y, then xy = 1 and that's not less than 1. 
 

45
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:29,333
In other words, the order in which we place the quantifiers can sometimes matter! It takes careful mathematical reasoning to see when 

46
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:35,533
these statements are true and when they are false. But that's what this whole course is about, so it's good work. 
 

47
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:42,633
That brings us to the end of this module on logic. You're learning a lot, so congratulations! Our next module is about two more 

48
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:50,666
fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie computer science: The concept of the *set*, which is the model for all data structures 

49
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:58,699
in computer science, and the concept of the *function* which is the model for all programs. Pretty big ideas, in other words. See you there.
