# Scripts for Module 2 videos 

## 2.1

Human beings communicate with each other using language. Computers use languages too, but they don't really look (at least not yet) like human languages. In this next module of videos, we're going to look at the question of how we take our human language and turn it into something that we can use to communicate with machines. This isn't going to be a full course on language design like you might study later. Rather just as in the first module, we're going to take a look at the foundations: To the basics of our language to see what works in EVERY computer programming language you might choose to study or use. 

So what aspects of language ARE usable by computers? Well, keep in mind that computers (as much as we might suspect otherwise) do not actually "think" and cannot process language, really cannot process anything other than bits. But this connection to bits gives us a way to bridge human language with computer operations: We can use the bits to represent the two opposing states of TRUE and FALSE. If computers process bits, they can process truth values --- sometimes called Boolean values in computer languages. A 1 represents TRUE, and a 0 represents FALSE.

So if we restrict human language only to those statements that can be validated as true or false, that's how we can "talk with" computers. The study of reasoning using strict rules of validation of truth, is called logic. So at the foundations of how we work with computers, is not only mathematics as we saw earlier, but also logic. 

Statements that can be validated as true or false, are known as propositions. Although sometimes we'll just call them "Statements". A proposition in other words is a complete thought --- often a complete sentence or mathematical expression --- that has a definite and knowable truth value. Some examples include: 

Some non-examples (things that are NOT propositions) include:
