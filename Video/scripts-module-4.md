## Module 4 video scripts

## 4.1 

- what is combinatorics 
- Making a single choice from multiple bins (and bins are disjoint)
  - *Additive Principle*
  - Example: choosing shirts of different colors 
- When the bins are not disjoint
  - Choosing shirts that are either red or long-sleeve
  - Double-counts any that are both
  - *Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion* 

Welcome to Module 4! So far in this series of videos, we've learned about how computers represent and work with integers, about the logic behind how those and other computer operations work, and in Module 3 we learned about sets and functions which are the prototypes for computer data structures and programs. All of that materiall lays the groundwork for what the next two moodules are about -- thinking mathematically about underlying problems that show up throughout computer sccience. 



## 4.2

- When making a sequence of choices that are independent of each other 
- *Multiplicative principle* 
- Example: Choosing an outfit of shirt, pants, shoes
- Example: License plates
