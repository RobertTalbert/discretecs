## 2.1 What is a logical proposition

- Humans communicate with each other using language. Computers don't. How do we communicate with computers? 
- Through LOGIC -- reasoning that uses strict rules of validity
- Start with statements whose validity can be judged: Propositions
  - A complete sentence (verbal or mathematical) that has a definite and knowable truth value 
  - Examples: verbal and math
  - Non examples
    - Interjections
    - Opinions
    - Incomplete thoughts
    - Underdetermined statements 
- Practice: ID the propositions and non-propositions



## 2.2 AND, OR, and NOT

- Two kinds of propositions: 
  - Atomic 
  - Compound or "molecular" -- atomic statements joined by connectives
- The truth value of the molecular statement is determined by the truth values of its atomic statements and what kind of connective is being used. 
- Example: "this course requires both algebra and intro to python as prerequisites" vs "this course requires either algebra or intro to python as prerequisites" 
- AND (conjunction): A ^ B is true whenever A and B are both true, false otherwise. 
- OR (disjunction): A v B is true if either A or B or both are true, false otherwise ("inclusive or") 
- NOT (negation): ~A is true if A is false, ~A is false when A is true
- Examples (including code) 

## 2.3 Conditional statements 

- If-then statements -- they are everywhere -- another kind of connective 
- Conditional statement
  - Hypothesis 
  - Conclusion
- When is a CS true? 
  - When is a CS FALSE? -- Like a broken promise -- happens when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false
  - CS is true in ALL OTHER CASES
  - The truth table for a CS 
- Why isn't the CS false if the hypothesis is false?
  - That would mean that the promise is broken, but that's not always the case
  - Example: If 


## 2.4 Variations on conditional statements

- If A, then B 
- Converse: If B, then A
- Contrapositive: If not B, then not A
- Inverse: If not A, then not B
- Do they all mean the same? Look at "If it's raining, then it's cloudy"  (pause the video etc.) 
  - Converse; If it's cloudy then it;s raining
  - Contrapositive: If it's not cloudy then it's not raining
  - Inverse: If it's not raining then it's not cloudy
  - The original and the contrapositive both seem true. The converse and inverse don't. So converse and inverse are not "logically the same as" the original but the contrapositive might be.
