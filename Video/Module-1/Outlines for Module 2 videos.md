## 2.1 What is a logical proposition

- Humans communicate with each other using language. Computers don't. How do we communicate with computers? 
- Through LOGIC -- reasoning that uses strict rules of validity
- Start with statements whose validity can be judged: Propositions
  - A complete sentence (verbal or mathematical) that has a definite and knowable truth value 
  - Examples: verbal and math
  - Non examples
    - Interjections
    - Opinions
    - Incomplete thoughts
    - Underdetermined statements 
- Practice: ID the propositions and non-propositions



## 2.2 AND, OR, and NOT

- Two kinds of propositions: 
  - Atomic 
  - Compound or "molecular" -- atomic statements joined by connectives
- The truth value of the molecular statement is determined by the truth values of its atomic statements and what kind of connective is being used. 
- Example: "this course requires both algebra and intro to python as prerequisites" vs "this course requires either algebra or intro to python as prerequisites" 
- AND (conjunction): A ^ B is true whenever A and B are both true, false otherwise. 
- OR (disjunction): A v B is true if either A or B or both are true, false otherwise ("inclusive or") 
- NOT (negation): ~A is true if A is false, ~A is false when A is true
- Examples (including code)
