MTH 325: Discrete Structures for CS 2 -- Grading System
=========================================================

# Student work in the course 

Students in MTH 325 will have the following work available to them: 

+ 29 learning modules, described in the Modules document. 
+ Guided Practice to assist in preparing for class, graded on 0/1/2 scale on the basis of completeness and effort. 
+ Periodic Concept Quizzes to test for competence in definitions, theorem statements, and basic ideas. 10 points each and usually objective (multiple choice, T/F, fill in the blank). 
+ Nine timed modules, one for each of the nine module areas, consisting of problems similar to those on "Level 1" untimed modules. Will set up at least four hour-long sessions for students to work these problems. Students work on as many of these as they want during each session and can retake in later sessions. 
+ Application Project.
