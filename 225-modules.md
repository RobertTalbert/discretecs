# Module structure for MTH 225 Fall 2020 

## Topics from SOR

1. **Arithmetic**: Representation and arithmetic with integers in base 2, 8, 10, and 16; binary arithmetic; the modulo operator and modular arithmetic (1-2 weeks)
2. **Logic**: Propositions, conditional statements; conjunctions, disjunctions and negations; truth tables; logical equivalence; predicates and quantification (2-3 weeks)
3. **Sets and Functions**: Set notation; subset and element relations; union, intersection, and complement; Venn diagrams; cardinality and power sets; Cartesian products; functions and non-functions; injective, surjective, and bijective functions; special functions for CS (floor, ceiling, etc.) (2-3 weeks)
4. **Combinatorics**: Additive and multiplicative principles; binomial coefficients (intro to recurrence relations and recursion); combinations and permutations; principle of inclusion and exclusion; combinatorial proofs (3-4 weeks)
5. **Sequences and Recursion**: Closed-formula and recursive definitions of sequences; arithmetic and geometric sequences; polynomial fitting; solving recurrence relations; proofs using (weak) mathematical induction. (3-4 weeks, with proof by induction occupying 1-2 of those weeks)
