    "# Lesson 1: Recursively defined structures \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary:__ This lesson introduces a unifying theme in the course: the concept of __recursion__. Recursion refers to the process of computing something in terms of smaller or prior versions of itself. It is a computational technique, and a way of defining certain kinds of structures, that is common and powerful in computer science -- but also mysterious and not always well understood. In this lesson we will encounter recursion by looking at mathematical and computer science objects that are defined using recursive definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson addresses the following learning target(s): \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __RI.1:__ I can construct several instances of a recursively defined structure, such as integer sequences, graphs, and trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The _factorial_ function is very commonly used in discrete mathematics. We can define the factorial function _directly_ as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Definition:__ Given a positive integer $n$, the __factorial__ of $n$, denoted $n!$, is defined to be the number $n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times \\cdots \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$. Additionally, we define $0!$ to be equal to $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for instance, $4!$ is $4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$, which equals $24$. We use the factorial a lot in counting arguments, because $n!$ counts the number of ways to take a collection of $n$ different objects and put them in order. For instance, look at the letters A, B, C, and D and try to arrange these in different order, like ABCD, ABDC, ACBD, and so on -- eventually you should come up with 24 different arrangements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Did you notice that the factorial function has an interesting _structure_ to it? In particular, _the factorial function is computed in terms of smaller versions of itself_. Here is an alternative definition of the factorial function that uses this structure: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Definition:__ Define $0!$ to be equal to $1$. Then, for any positive integer $n$, the __factorial__ of $n$, denoted $n!$, is given by $n! = n \\times (n-1)!$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This seems strange -- it seems like there is really no definition happening here because we are defining $n!$ in terms of another factorial, namely $(n-1)!$. Does this definition really work? Let's try to compute $4!$ again using this new definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Step 1: $4!$ is defined to be $4 \\times 3!$. So... what is $3!$ equal to? \n",
    "+ Step 2: $3!$ is defined to be $3 \\times 2!$. So... what is $2!$ equal to? \n",
    "+ Step 3: $2!$ is defined to be $2 \\times 1!$. So... what is $1!$ equal to? \n",
    "+ Step 4: $1!$ is defined to be $1 \\times 0!$. By definition, we know that $0! = 1$. Therefore $1! = 1 \\times 0! = 1 \\times 1 = 1$. \n",
    "+ Step 5: Now we have that $1! = 1$. Therefore $2! = 2 \\times 1! = 2 \\times 1$. Therefore $3! = 3 \\times 2! = 3 \\times (2 \\times 1)$. Therefore $4! = 4 \\times 3! = 4 \\times (3 \\times (2 \\times 1))$ which equals $24$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What just happened? We computed $4!$ by _calling_ $3!$, that is by using a _smaller, simpler factorial_. Then we had to find $3!$ by _calling_ $2!$, again a smaller and simpler factorial. Then we found $2!$ by calling $1!$ and $1!$ by calling $0!$. Then, finally, we have a definite numerical value for $0!$ -- namely, it's equal to $1$ -- and so we were able to back-substitute everything and eventually calculate _all_ of the factorials we used. \n",
    "\n",
    "This second definition of factorial that computes a factorial in terms of smaller factorials is called a __recursive definition__, and the computation that we did uses __recursion__. \n",
    "\n",
    "A recursively defined structure -- like the factorial of an integer -- is a lot like a set of Russian dolls, like the ones shown in the video: "

    "It looks like one doll at first, but then you open it up to find a smaller doll inside, which has another smaller doll inside, which has another smaller doll inside, and so on -- until you end up with one, tiny doll that cannot be reduced down any further. Then, at that point you have the whole family of dolls. \n",

    "Can we compute the factorial of a _negative_ integer, like $(-3)!$? Let's try using the recursive definition and see what happens: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The definition would say that $(-3)!$ is equal to $(-3) \\times (-4)!$ because the new factorial is one less than the previous one. \n",
    "+ Then we would recursively call the definition on $(-4)!$, which would give us $(-3)! = (-3) \\times ((-4) \\times (-5)!$. \n",
    "+ Then we would recursively call the definition on $(-5)!$, which would give us $(-3)! = (-3) \\times \\left((-4) \\times ((-5) \\times (-6)!)\\right)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll stop at this point, because do you see what's happening? We're stuck in an infinite process. When we were computing $4!$, the process ended because we subtracted 1 repeatedly and eventually hit 0, whose factorial value we had defined to equal $1$. But here, we can keep on subtracting 1 but we will never \"hit bottom\". The process just continues forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that there are two essential ingredients to a correctly-formed recursive definition of a structure:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. There must be a __rule__ for how to construct the structure from previous, simpler versions of the structure. And,\n",
    "2. There must be a __base case__ that allows us to make a computation _without_ recursion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our definition of the factorial, the rule was that $n! = n \\times (n-1)!$ when $n$ is a positive integer; and the base case is the declaration that $0! = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another kind of structure that can be recursively defined are _integer sequences_. Here is a famous example: \n",
    "\n",
    ">Definition: The __Fibonacci sequence__ is the sequence of integers given by \n",
    "$$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, \\dots$$\n",
    "The first number in the sequence is denoted $F_1$, the second $F_2$, and so on. \n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively as follows: \n",
    "+ (Base case) We define $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$. \n",
    "+ (Recursive rule) For all $n > 2$, define $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$. (That is, each Fibonacci number starting with the third one is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.) \n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, what is $F_6$? We can see from the sequence that it should be $8$, but if that list of integers weren't there and all we had was the definition, how would we know? According to the definition, $F_6$ equals $F_5 + F_4$. Now we'll \"unpack\" each of $F_5$ and $F_4$ using the definition. Every set of nested parentheses below is an instance of this \"unpacking\". Remember we don't have to \"unpack\" $F_2$ or $F_1$ because those are _defined_ to be equal to $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "F_6 &= F_5 + F_4 \\\\ \n",
    "&= (F_4 + F_3) + (F_3 + F_2) \\\\\n",
    "&= ((F_3 + F_2) + (F_2 + F_1)) + ((F_2 + F_1) + F_2) \\\\\n",
    "&= (((F_2 + F_1 )+ F_2) + (F_2 + F_1)) + ((F_2 + F_1) + F_2)\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each of these numbers on the right now equals 1 by definition, we can plug in $1$ for each of them and see that $F_6 = 8$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's one more example to illustrate the idea that recursively defined structures are not always numbers or sequences of numbers. This has to do with _strings_. A __palindrome__ is a word that is spelled the same forwards as it is backwards, like `RACECAR` or `NOON` or `KAYAK`. We can extend this idea to say that any string of characters, so for example the string `XYQQZQQYX` is a palindrome. What's a way to formally define a palindrome? Here is a recursive definition:\n",
    "\n",
    ">__Definition:__ Let $\\lambda$ be a string of characters from the English alphabet. The empty string is defined to be a palindrome. A single character is also defined to be a palindrome, and a two-letter string formed from the same letter (for example `RR`) is a palindrome. Finally, if $\\alpha$ is any single character and $\\lambda$ is a palindrome, then the string $\\alpha + \\lambda + \\alpha$ is also a palindrome where `+` stands for concatenation of strings (as in Python). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a recursive definition because it gives appropriate base cases (the empty strings and single letters are defined to be palindromes, which makes sense) and then a way of generating a new palindrome out of smaller ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's play with that definition to get a few examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "+ According to the base case, we can pick any letter we want and it's a palindrome, so `K` is a palindrome. \n",
    "+ Since `K` is a palindrome, according to the recursive rule I can choose any other character I wish and sandwich `K` in between them, and I will have another palindrome, so for example `EKE` is a palindrome. \n",
    "+ Since `EKE` is a palindrome, so is `REKER` for example. And so would be `PREKER`, `ZPREKERZ`, and so on. \n",
    "+ Another basic example would be `NN`. So another palindrome could be `ANNA`, and therefore `BANNAB`, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive definition allows you to _construct_ something, namely a palindromic string. This might be useful if, for example, we wanted to write a computer program that accepts a string as input and determines whether it is a palindrome. \n",
