    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary:__ In this lesson we begin a multi-part review of _proof by induction_, a technique for proving that a mathematical proposition that involves recursion is always true. You first encountered proof by induction in MTH 225. We'll be extending our ideas about induction in MTH 325 to include variations on the basic theme, and taking special care to connect induction to recursion. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson addresses the following learning target(s): \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __RI.2:__ I can outline and analyze a mathematical proof using mathematical induction over the positive integers, weak induction, strong induction, and structural induction.\n",
    "+ __RI.3:__ I can construct a correct proof using mathematical induction over the positive integers, weak induction, strong induction, or structural induction. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson focuses particularly on basic induction over the positive integers. \"Strong\" and \"structural\" induction are the subjects of lessons 3 and 4 respectively. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [last lesson](http://bit.ly/1R0WfGT), we talked about the _Fibonacci sequence_. Let's suppose that I wanted to give you a quick oral exam to see whether you _prove_ to me that you really understood how the Fibonacci sequence works. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way that _wouldn't_ work is if you just recited the first few numbers in the sequence -- that is, you just said that the Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 \"and so on\". This doesn't  prove, conclusively, that you understand the Fibonacci numbers because _anybody_ could just memorize the first five elements of the sequence. This doesn't show me that you understand the essence of how this sequence is constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that wouldn't work is if you recited a _longer_ list of numbers in the sequence -- that is, if you said that the Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 \"and so on\". While this is harder to do than reciting the first five numbers in the sequence, it's still just memorization, and anybody with good memory could do it without having a clue of how the Fibonacci sequence works. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, _no amount of examples is enough_ to prove to me that you understand the sequence if all you are doing is giving examples. Because, how do I know that you understand the math, and not just that you have an excellent memory? \n",
    "\n",
    "What _would_ demonstrate sufficient evidence that you understand the Fibonacci numbers? Well, what would have to happen is that you would __explain how ANY Fibonacci number regardless of its location in the sequence is built__. That is, proof that you understand the Fibonacci sequence would require not a demonstration of examples but an _explanation of why_ the examples are what they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quick exam that would generate enough evidence to convince a skeptic that you understand the Fibonacci sequence could go like this, in two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, give me a list of the first three Fibonacci numbers to show me that you know how the sequence begins. \n",
    "2. Then, I'll give you a list of the first 11 Fibonacci numbers and ask you to explain how to get the twelfth one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that this is different than just listing numbers, because the second step asks you __explain how__ to get $F_{12}$ and not just _state_ $F_{12}$. If you can do these two things, then (1) I know that you know how to _start_ the sequence, and (2) I know that you know how to _continue_ the sequence indefinitely. Therefore given enough time, you could build any Fibonacci number in the list, and it doesn't depend on memorizing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a proof? \n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is typical of how you, as a fledgeling computer scientist, will need to _reason about computer science_ both now and in the future. For example, you will be called upon in your career to write code or design algorithms that claim to accomplish a certain task -- say, for example, quickly searching a database to find a record. You can write the code, and it may _appear_ to work based on a few examples that you run, but to make this code really workable in the real world there are tough questions you have to answer such as \n",
    "\n",
    "+ How do you know that your program _always_ produces the correct output _any time_ the correct input is put in? \n",
    "+ How do you know that your program _always_ terminates? \n",
    "+ How do you know that your program _always_ runs efficiently? \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how merely reciting a list of Fibonacci numbers does not mean that you understand the Fibonacci numbers, merely producing a list of correct outputs -- even a maassive one -- does not prove that your program _always_ works. How do we know that the _next_ example, the one you _didn't_ try, doesn't crash the program? Something more is needed in order to make that knowledge certain. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide conclusive knowledge that a desired result _always_ happens when the set of inputs is potentially infinite, we can't just produce examples. We have to create what is called a __proof__. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Definition: A __proof__ is a convincing argument that is logically sound, clearly communicated, and free of error that explains why a conjecture is always true. \n",
    "\n",
    "A _conjecture_ is just an educated guess about a pattern that we notice. For example, you can make a conjecture that your program always produces the correct output, by running examples and making observations. But there, the usefulness of examples ends -- and to _prove_ that the program always works we need something that goes beyond examples, that perhaps uses the essence of what we see in the examples to make a __general argument__, that is, an argument that does not depend on specific instances. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Key point:__ A list of examples does not constitute a proof. And a completed proof must be _logically sound_, _clearly communicated_, _free of error_, and _completely devoid of examples_. \n",
    "\n",
    "In MTH 225 you learned about several ways to construct proofs of mathematical conjectures -- direct proof, proof by contrapositive, proof by contradiction, and proof by mathematical induction. While all of these are important, induction will be our main focus now and in the next few lessons. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Proof by mathematical induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical induction is a technique for proof that involves claims about propositions that are true over the positive integers. Here's an example: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proposition:__ For every positive integer $n$, the Fibonacci number $F_{3n}$ is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe that this proposition appears to be true by looking at instances of the proposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "| $F_3$ | $F_6$ | $F_9$ | $F_{12}$ | $F_{15}$ | \n",
    "|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|\n",
    "| 2 | 8 | 34 | 144 | 610 |\n",
    "\n",
    "This table demonstrates that the proposition is _sometimes_ true (because in each of these instances, an index that is a multiple of 3 produces an even number), but it doesn't prove that the statement is _always_ true. No table ever will, because the proposition is claimed to be true _for all_ positive integers, of which there is an infinite amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "The proposition above has two parts to it: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ A _statement_: \"...the Fibonacci number $F_{3n}$ is even.\" \n",
    "+ A _quantifier_ for that statement: \"For every positive integer $n$...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement above is actually what we call a __predicate__, which is a statement with one or more variables in it and the statement might be true or false depending on the value of the variable. For example, here is another predicate: \n",
    "\n",
    ">The number $\\sqrt{n}$ is an integer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly this predicate is not _always_ true. For example if you plug in $n = 5$ the statement is false. But the predicate is _sometimes_ true, for example if you plug in $n = 16$. Another way to think about predicates is that they are _functions whose outputs are Booleans_ -- i.e. you plug something in, and the output is `True` or `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We don't talk about predicates as being \"true\" or \"false\" because their truth value depends on the input. Instead, we talk about the __truth set__ of a predicate, which is the set of all inputs that produce `True` as an output. For example the truth set of the square-root predicate above would be $\\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, \\dots\\}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A predicate _by itself_ does not have a truth value, but when we attach a __quantifier__ to the predicate, it _does_ have a truth value. For example, modify the predicate above to add a universal quantifier: \n",
    "\n",
    ">For all positive integers $n$, the number $\\sqrt{n}$ is an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposition -- it's no longer a \"predicate\" because the variable no longer varies -- is definitely FALSE because it is not true \"for all positive integers\". The integer $n = 5$ would be a counterexample. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to the Fibonacci sequence. Here is the proposition we stated: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proposition:__ For every positive integer $n$, the Fibonacci number $F_{3n}$ is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are claiming that this predicate with the universal quantifier attached is true. We cannot prove it through example-listing. Instead, we will use _mathematical induction_. __Mathematical induction is very commonly used on propositions that consist of predicates, quantified over the positive integers.__ (We'll see some important variations on that rule of thumb in Lessons 3 and 4.) \n",
    "\n",
    "A proof by mathematical induction has __three distinct steps__: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Base case:__ Show via an example that the predicate is true in the smallest possible case. \n",
    "2. __Induction hypothesis:__ Assume that the predicate is true for some arbitrary positive integer, say $k$. \n",
    "3. __Inductive step:__ Having assumed the induction hypothesis, prove that the predicate is true for the _next_ positive integer, that is $k+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is a completed proof by induction for the proposition above. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proof:__ For the base case, we will show that the predicate is true when $n=1$. That is, we show that $F_3$ is even. By definition, $F_3 = 2$ and this is even, so the base case is established. Now for the inductive hypothesis, assume that $F_{3k}$ is even for some positive integer $k$. We want to show that $F_{3(k+1)}$ is even. That is, we want to show that $F_{3k+3}$ is even. By the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, $F_{3k+3}$ is the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers: \n",
    "$$F_{3k+3} = F_{3k+2} + F_{3k+1}$$\n",
    "Using the same logic, we can split up $F_{3k+2}$:\n",
    "$$F_{3k+3} = (F_{3k+1} + F_{3k}) + F_{3k+1}$$\n",
    "This equals $2 F_{3k+1} + F_{3k}$. By the inductive hypothesis we have assumed that $F_{3k}$ is even. Note that $2 F_{3k+1}$ is even because it is a multiple of 2. And we know* that the sum of two even integers is another even integer. Therefore $F_{3k+3}$ is even, which is what we wanted to show. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\ast$ _In the context of MTH 225 and MTH 325, we usually prove that the sum of two even integers is an even integer as a basic exercise; and it's OK to assume the results of such exercises in later proofs, just like you reuse code from earlier projects in new projects._ \n",
    "\n",
    "Why does a proof by induction work? That is, why should we accept it as being convincing? It's like my oral exam on Fibonacci numbers. In the base case, we demonstrate that the predicate is _sometimes_ true particularly in the smallest case. Then, if I allow you to assume that the predicate is true _up to a point_, what I'm interested in is if you can _explain how to get from that arbtirary place to the next place_. If you can do those two things, then you have transcended examples -- you have shown _how to construct examples_ which is sufficient proof to appease anybody as long as they agree with you on basic definitions. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Before we move on:__ A little anecdote. I have a nephew who is completing his first year in the M.S. program in Computer Science at a major American university. He's a smart guy but has struggled in his first year because _his undergrad courses never dealt much with proof by induction_. I asked him as I was putting the course together what he wished he had known better before starting graduate school and he gave me three answers: (1) induction, (2) induction, and (3) induction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical induction is the primary method of proof used by computer scientists because it is the flip side of recursion. Did you notice in the induction proof above that we used a recursive step to revert the proposition back to a simpler version of itself? This natural relationship between induction and recursion is the main unifying theme of the entire MTH 325 course. We will use induction ~~repeatedly~~ incessantly throughout the course to prove useful properties about relations, graphs, and trees -- anywhere recursive structures show up. \n",
