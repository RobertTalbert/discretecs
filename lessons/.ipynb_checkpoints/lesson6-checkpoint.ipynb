    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "__Summary:__ We have already seen the concept of the _recurrence relation_ show up in our course as a way of generating integer sequences using recursion. A big question for us is: _Is it possible to take an integer sequence that's defined using a recurrence relation and define it directly using a formula instead?_ In Lesson 6, we will start to answer that question by learning more about recurrence relations, what it means to _solve_ a recurrence relation, and how to find solutions to simple recurrence relations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Lesson 7 we will think about how to find solutions for more complicated recurrence relations (namely the \"second-order linear homogeneous\" recurrence relations mentioned in learning target RI.4). \n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson addresses the following learning target(s): \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __RI.4:__ I can solve a first- or second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation by hand.\n",

    "### Part 1: The Towers of Hanoi\n",
    "\n",
    "A classic logic puzzle called the __Towers of Hanoi problem__ goes like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "In a monastery in Hanoi, there is a set of three tall pillars. Large concentric disks are stacked on the leftmost pillar. They are all different sizes and are stacked in order from largest (on the bottom) to smallest (on the top): \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hanoi.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The monks have to move the disks to a different pillar, while following these rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ Only one disk at a time can be moved. \n",
    "+ No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk. \n",
    "+ Each disk must be put in place before another can be moved. (You can't hold one in your hand and then move another.) \n",
    "\n",
    "So once the monks are done, it could look like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hanoiflip.jpeg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Or it could look like this with the disks stacked in the middle. \n",
    "\n",
    "The puzzle is to determine whether it's possible to move the entire stack of disks in this way, while following the rules; and if it's possible, determine the _least number of moves necessary_ in order to get it into the final state. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll go ahead and stipulate that yes, it is always possible to do this. And the minimum number of steps needed depends on the number of disks in the stack. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is only one disk, then clearly only 1 move is necessary. Just move the one disk to the third post. If there are two disks, like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hanoi2.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "then the smallest number of moves needed is __3__: Move disk 1 to post B, then disk 2 to post C, then disk 1 to post C. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Here is an online version of this puzzle](http://www.softschools.com/games/logic_games/tower_of_hanoi/) that you play with to solve this puzzle. Before moving on, play with this puzzle to see if you can find the solution in the _smallest_ number of steps for 3 disks, 4 disks, even 5 disks or more. \n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend turning the sound off. If you need to restart the game with the _same_ number of disks, click \"Restart\". If you need to restart the game with a _different_ number of disks, you have to refresh the page. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Recurrence relations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $T(n)$ be the minimum number of steps needed to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem using $n$ disks. We already determined that $T(1) = 1$ and $T(2) = 3$. Your <strike>research</strike> play hopefully determined $T(3)$, $T(4)$, $T(5)$, and maybe a few more. __Spoiler alert:__ The first few values of $T$ are in the table: \n",

    "__STOP at this point and make a guess as to a formula for $T(n)$.__ Hint: If you add 1 to the bottom row, the pattern becomes a little easier to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "To test out your formula, put it into the place indicated in line 2 of the Python code below, then execute the Python cell (Shift-Enter). If it works, the list comprehension in the last line will produce `[1,3,7,15,31,63]`. For example purposes, we have put an _incorrect_ formula in line 2, to show you what you should be putting (just a simple formula) and the fact that it doesn't produce the right list. "

    "This sort of relationship, where a term in a sequence is related back to a previous term of the sequence, is called a __recurrence relation__. The data that $T(1) = 2$ is called an __initial condition__ for the recurrence relation, and it allows us to compute the entire sequence -- we start with the initial condition $T(1) = 2$. From there the recurrence relation would say $T(2) = 2T(1) + 1 = 2(1) + 1 = 3$. Then $T(3) = 2T(2) + 1 = 2(3) + 1 = 7$. And so on. \n",

    "\n",
    ">__Definition__: The higher number of backwards steps needed to compute the term of sequence using a recurrence relation is called the __order__ of the recurrence relation. \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Definition:__ A __closed formula__ for a sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\dots$ is a formula for $a_n$ that uses a fixed, finite number of operations involving $n$ and no recursion. \n",

    "Examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The Fibonacci sequence $F_n$ is defined recursively, with the recurrence relation $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ and initial conditions $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$. This is a _second-order_ recurrence relation because to compute $F_n$ one has to go back two steps to $F_{n-2}$. \n",
    "+ The Towers of Hanoi sequence $T(n)$ is defined recursively with the recurrence relation $T(n) = 2T(n-1) + 1$ and initial condition $T(1) = 1$. This is a _first-order_ recurrence relation because only one backward step is needed. \n",
    "+ Here is a third-order recurrence relation: $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-3} + n^2$. Note we cannot compute the sequence generated by it because we don't have any initial conditions given. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Spoilers again:__ You should have found that a closed formula for $T(n)$ is $T(n) = 2^n - 1$. Or, at least it _appears_ to be a closed formula. We only know it produces the right numbers in the sequence some of the time. Another important term: \n",
