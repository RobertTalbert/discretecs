# MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1

![](mth225-logo.png)

>Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.

## About MTH 225 and this syllabus

**Welcome to MTH 225!** I'm Dr. Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm grateful you're here. 

In this course, you will learn **the math that all of computer science is based on**. You'll learn things like how to do arithmetic in binary, how to count the number of ways to deal a five-card poker hand, and how to generate complex data structures using simple rules involving recursion. And more! By studying discrete structures, **you'll gain a superpower to make you an expert learner of any hardware and any software, including those that haven't been invented yet**. As a computer scientist, your ability to learn new things quickly, and use fundamental concepts to model complex ideas, are more valuable than your coding skills. 

**This syllabus contains all the information you need to navigate the course.** The main document will be kept continuously up to date at this link. When you see blue- or purple-underlined text in the syllabus or any other document, it's a clickable link. For example, [click here for a cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuUidBR1aQ). A PDF version of the syllabus will also be available on Blackboard, but it will not be updated unless there is a major change. 

**This document is meant to be read once, then searched as needed.** If you need to find something, the easiest way is to pull up this  document, hit `Control-F` or `Command-F`, and then do a search for the text you're looking for. 

All course materials for MTH 225 are available on GitHub at https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs. The current version is in the folder `MTH225-Winter2024`. Critically important documents (syllabus, etc.) will also be on Blackboard.

**Technology:** Please plan on bringing a laptop or tablet (laptop preferred) to class each day for group work. It's highly recommended to have access to a high-speed internet connection for work outside of class. You will need access to a basic handheld calculator for Checkpoint assessments in class. There is no preferred model of device. Please review the Class Technology Policy for acceptable use. 

## What you will learn

(Course description) 

## How to succeed 

All important learning experiences you've ever had, or will have, are the result of a **feedback loop**: You try something, then you get feedback on your attempt, then you think about and make sense of the feedback, then you use the feedback in another attempt. And this loop continues until the thing you are trying meets a standard of quality.

Being successful in MTH 225 means two things: **Mastering the basic skills of discrete mathematics** and **successfully applying those basic skills to hard problems**. The way to become good at these two things, is by **engaging with the activities and the feedback loops in the course** that are set up for you. And this engagement involves a number of simple actions and behaviors that you will need to show consistently: 

- **Attending class**, and not only being physically present but **mentally engaged and participatory** in class activities.
- **Blocking off daily times** for working on the class outside of class meetings.
- **Mindful practice on basic skills** during those daily work times. 
- **Careful understanding of feedback** on your work so that you can incorporate it into later attempts intelligently. 
- **Consistent submission of attempts** on class work, described later. 
- **Asking questions about math** in drop-in hours, class meetings, or emails. 

Successful MTH 225 students have this in common: They all engage in these behaviors and do these actions consistently, every day throughout the course. Unsuccessful students typically fail to be consistent in one or more of these. **The common denominator is focus and consistency** -- you do not have to be a "math genius" to do well in MTH 225! You just have to **consistently engage with the feedback loops** that are there for you. 

**I want you to be successful in this class.** I am personally invested in each student mastering all of the important topics and learning objectives listed in the previous section, and in your growth as a learner. I will challenge and support you, and if you engage with the learning activities and the feedback you receive, you will learn a lot and have a great experience. 

## The work you will do 




- Three axes: Basic skills, applications, engagement
- Basic skills
  - Listed in list of "Skills" 
  - Six Core Skills 
  - Ten Supplemental Skills 
  - Demonstrate competence in each Skill
    - Primarily through Checkpoints 
    - But other options will be available (such as?)
  - Two successful demonstrations needed on each skill to "Pass" or "Master" it 
- Applications
  - Challenge problems
  - Big list of problems, will be added to over time 
  - Not simple homework problems! Require careful thought, multiple iterations, good communication -- they often focus on the mega skills 
- Engagement
  - Includes things like attending class, completing pre-class work, completing ungraded practice sets, doing other things to show you're dialed in to the course
  - Items of engagement are given point values "Engagement credits" -- accumulate these over time 


## How you will be evaluated and graded

- Overview
  - We do not use a traditional grading system where there are points and one-and-done assessments
  - Most items have no point value (exception Engagement Credits)
  - Those items without points are graded either "Success" or "Retry" based on whether they meet quality standards -- see Standards document -- no partial credit
  - The Standards document lists exactly what you will be asked to do on each item and what is expected of you -- read it along with this syllabus 
  - Instead, you get reattempts on things that are graded "Retry". No penalty for a Retry. 
  - This fits with the idea of a feedback loop.
- Table: Common assignments, how they are graded, what shows up in Blackboard 
  - Engagement- Shows up individually with EC's, and there's a running Engagement Credit total column
  - Skills- Listed individually, Level 0, 1 or 2 according to how many successful demonstrations you've made so far -- Checkpoint items themselves will be listed Success or Retry
  - Challenge problems- Listed individually, Success or Retry 
- Table showing how course grades are assigned 
- Plus and minus grades 
  - Final exam 
  - Plus: Meet all requirements for a base grade and then earn 85% or higher on the final
  - Minus: Meet all requirements for a base grade except engagement credits; or meet all requirements for base grade and then earn 50% or lower on the final
  - There is no A+ and no D-; opposing plus/minus cancels out
- What if you're a borderline case or almost make it -- instructor discretion, especially looking at skills at level 1.

## How to get help

MTH 225 can be a challenging course, because the topics might be unfamiliar, and you'll be asked to think about doing mathematics in a way that you probably haven't been asked in your high school courses. You will almost certainly find yourself lost, stuck, or confused on *something* in this course at some point. **This is normal and not a cause for alarm.** 

When you get confused or stuck, try to get yourself unstuck first by thinking through your work. But then **ask questions and seek out help as soon as you need it.** You can do this in several ways: 

* **Participate actively in class** since most class activities are designed to align with major topics and assignments. 
* **Attend drop-in hours and ask questions there.** You can use the in-person drop-in hours (no appointment needed) or [schedule](https://calendly.com/robert-talbert/) an online meeting or an in-person meeting at other times if drop-in hours don't work for you. 
* **Work with a classmate** as long as you're staying within bounds on academic integrity above. 

**Math Tutoring Center:** GVSU’s Math Tutoring Center offers both in-person and online drop-in tutoring this semester.  You can access the most up-to-date information at http://gvsu.edu/tutoring/math/.  There you will find our current hours, information on how to access online tutoring with Discord Voice and a schedule of when you can find tutors to help with your specific course.  Bring questions to any center about using technology (calculator or Desmos), on methods and concepts, or on specific problems.  All Math Center tutoring is FREE, so stop by early and often.  

## Other Course Policies 

**Instructor availability and responses:** I strive to respond promptly to all student emails. However, please note that **I do not typically check email between 6:00pm and 6:00am on weekdays, and I do not check it at all on weekends** in order to prioritize time for family and rest. If you send a message on a weekday (Monday-Friday) before 3:00pm ET and you need a response, you will get a response *the same day*. Emails received after 3:00pm ET Monday-Thursday will get a response *the following day*. Emails received after 3:00pm ET on Fridays will get a response *the following Monday* at latest. Please plan ahead with this policy in mind! 

**Attendance:** Consistent attendance is critical for success in MTH 225, and you are expected to attend each class meeting unless it is physically impossible. Attendance will be recorded and assigned engagement credits (1 credit per class meeting). Since you have many opportunities to earn engagement credits, there are no makeups or allowances for medical and other situations. Students who do not attend class consistently will be contacted to discuss their situations further. If you have a life situation that makes consistent attendance difficult, please bring it to my attention immediately so we can discuss your options. 

**Announcements:** Announcements will be posted every Sunday morning on Blackboard in a single "announcement drop". Supplemental announcements may be sent in the case of time-sensitive items that can't wait until Sunday. Each student is responsible for reading announcements carefully and maintaining awareness of their contents. 

**Late work and makeups:**

**Remote instruction:** https://www.gvsu.edu/provost/guidelines-for-course-delivery-in-the-event-of-253.htm

**Disability Support Resources:** If you have special needs because of learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at (616)331-2490 or http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/. DSR will help you arrange accommodations. Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

**Basic needs:** If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit [Replenish](https://www.gvsu.edu/replenish/), a food resource for GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.

**Gender identity and expression:** If, for purposes of gender identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

**Classroom and campus safety**: 



The professor reserves the right to adjust this syllabus as needed and will notify you of any changes through Blackboard announcements. 


## About the instructor 

I'm Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm a Professor of Mathematics and also work in the president's office. This is my 31st year of teaching overall. I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu) and a B.S. degree from [Tennessee Tech University](http://www.tntech.edu). 

I was, at best, a thoroughly mediocre math student in school until my senior year of high school, when I had a teacher for Calculus who stopped trying to cram things into my head and instead showed me the basics -- and then backed off, and let me work things out on my own (with support if I got stuck). Basically, this is how I teach today. 

After a two-year excursion as a Psychology major in college, I changed my major to math after a late-night dare from my roommate (long story) and, to my great surprise, I fell in love with the subject. I ended up getting a Ph.D. working in an obscure area at the intersection of abstract algebra and geometry, and I also discovered I loved teaching math to college students. So I went on to spend 14 years teaching in [small liberal arts colleges](http://franklincollege.edu) before coming to GVSU in 2011.

Now, I teach computer scientists and engineers how to think like mathematicians; I do research on how to make college teaching better; and I have an appointment as "Senior Faculty Fellow for Learning Futures", in which I coordinate research and development projects to make your learning experience better here. When nobody is looking, I'm working on my data science skills including learning the languages R and Julia. 

I live in Allendale with my family. I'm an avid bass guitar player, currently playing in the Grand Rapids and Muskegon areas with the bands [Taproom Fix](https://www.facebook.com/TaproomFixBand/) and Elleven. I also love the outdoors and get out to run, bicycle, or hike when I can. You can read more about what I'm thinking and doing at my website, [rtalbert.org](https://rtalbert.org), or at my "other blog" [Grading for Growth](https://gradingforgrowth.com) about alternative grading practices which I co-author with my GVSU colleague Prof. David Clark. I'm also on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberttalbert/). I will accept any connection request on LinkedIn from a student!
