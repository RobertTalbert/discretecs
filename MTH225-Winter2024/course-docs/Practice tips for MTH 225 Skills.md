# Practice tips for MTH 225 Skills 

## Core Skills 

### **C1**: I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation.

- Make up a conditional statement -- any statement of the form "If A, then B". For example, "If it's snowy, then it's cold". Try mixing up the ordering of the phrases, for example "It's cold if it's snowy." 
- In your notes, write the hypothesis, conclusion. converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation as you would on a Checkpoint. 
- Check your work with a friend, the professor, or an AI tool. (For example, type into an AI tool *What are the hypothesis, conclusion. converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation of the statement "It's cold if it's snowing"*)
- If you got parts of the example right, great! If not, study what you got wrong and write out in your notes what your misconception was. 
- Repeat the feedback loop until you are getting all parts right consistently. 



### **C2**: Given a statement to prove using mathematical induction, I can state the framework of a proof. (Identify the predicate, identify and prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and state what needs to be proven in the inductive step)

- Do a Google search on "Mathematical induction examples", or [find one in the textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_seq-induction.html). Pick a problem that is relatively simple. 
- Write out the framework as discussed in class. 
- Check work with a friend, the professor, or an AI tool. Note: The term "framework" is one that we have invented for this class and is not standard math terminology, so AI tools will not present the framework as you should present it. But it should give you something in which the parts of the framework can be picked out. 
- If you got parts of the example right, great! If not, study what you got wrong and write out in your notes what your misconception was. 
- Repeat the feedback loop until you are getting all parts right consistently. 

### **C3**: I can use set-theoretic notation correctly and convert a set from set-builder notation to roster notation and vice versa. 

- 

### **C4**: I can find the intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference, power set, cardinality, cartesian product, and complement of sets.

- Make up 3-4 small sets, with 1-5 elements each. 
- Go through and compute intersections, unions, differences, symmetric differences, power sets, cardinalities, and cartesian products of some randomly selected ones. 
- Check your work with a friend, the professor, or an AI tool. 
- If you got parts of the example right, great! If not, study what you got wrong and write out in your notes what your misconception was. 
- Repeat the feedback loop until you are getting all parts right consistently. 

There will also be a WeBWorK practice set covering this skill. 

### **C5**: I can apply the Additive and Multiplicative Principles and the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion to formulate and solve basic combinatorics problems.



### **C6**: I can compute factorials and binomial coefficients, and apply these concepts to solve basic combinatorics problems involving permutations, selections, and distributions.
