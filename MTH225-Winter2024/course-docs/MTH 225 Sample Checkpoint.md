# MTH 225: Sample Checkpoint 



This document is a full-scale model of a Checkpoint in MTH 225 with **all 16 Skills** represented. You will not get a Checkpoint with all 16 Skills on it until very late in the semester; typically Checkpoints contain **all six Core Skills** along with **any new Supplemental skills that have been covered in the course** and **any Supplemental skills from previous Checkpoints**. A full coverage schedule is in Appendix B of the syllabus. 

Typically, the Checkpoint itself with all the problems on it will be given in class with space provided for working out the Core skills. (To save space, this sample Checkpoint doesn't provide the space for the Core skills.) You will complete the Core skill problems in class. You may work on the Supplemental skills in class, but you will not turn those in on paper; instead you can work on those outside of class and you will submit your work as PDF files on Blackboard no later than noon the following day.

## Core Skills 

### C1

> I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation.

Consider the statement: **If x = 5, then print the next line.**  State, in clear English: 

1. The hypothesis of the statement
2. The conclusion of the statement
3. The converse of the statement
4. The contrapositive of the statement
5. The inverse of the statement
6. The negation of the statement (Do not just put "not" or "it is not the case that" in front of the statement)

**Success criteria:** All six items are correct and clearly stated.





### C2

> Given a statement to prove using mathematical induction, I can state the framework of a proof. (Identify the predicate, identify and prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and state what needs to be proven in the inductive step)



Suppose we want to prove the following statement using mathematical induction: 

> For every integer $n \geq 5$, $4n < 2^n$.  

1. Write out the predicate involved in this statement: $P(n)$ saysâ€¦
2. What value of $n$ corresponds to the base case? 
3. Prove that the base case holds, by direct computation or demonstration. 
4. Clearly state the inductive hypothesis without using the notation "$P(n)$". 
5. Clearly state what needs to be proven in the inductive step. Do not use the notation "$P(n)$" . You do NOT have to actually prove this statement; just state it. 

**Success criteria:** The predicate is correctly identified and has no quantifiers. The base case is correctly stated and has a complete and correct proof. The inductive hypothesis and proof step are correctly stated in specific terms.



### C3

> I can use set-theoretic notation correctly and convert a set from set-builder notation to roster notation and vice versa.



1. Below are several statements about sets and elements. Label each one as **TRUE** or **FALSE**. 

   a) $\lbrace 1,2,3\rbrace \subseteq \lbrace 0,1,2,3,4\rbrace$ 

   b) $25 \in \lbrace 1,2,4,8,16,\dots\rbrace$ 

   c) $3 \in \emptyset$ 

   d) $\emptyset \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ 

   e) $\mathbb{N} = \mathbb{Z}$ 

2. Here are three sets written in set-builder notation. For each, if the set is written using correct set syntax, rewrite it using roster notation. If the set is written using incorrect syntax, write **INCORRECT SYNTAX**. 

      a) $\lbrace 4n : n \in \mathbb{N} \rbrace$

      b) $\lbrace x \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, 2^n \rbrace$ 

      c) $\lbrace x \, \text{is odd} : x\in \{1,2,3,\dots 10\}\rbrace$

**Success criteria:** All items involving element, subset, and equality determinations are correct. All sets using incorrect set-builder syntax are correctly identified. Up to two simple mistakes are allowed in rewriting sets into roster notation.



### C4

> I can find the intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference, power set, cardinality, cartesian product, and complement of sets.

Let $A = \lbrace 1, 3,5\rbrace $, $B = \lbrace 2,3\rbrace$, $C = \lbrace 0, 5\rbrace $, and $D = \lbrace 7\rbrace$.  Find each of the following. You do not need to show intermediate steps, but this is often helpful for you (and for the person grading your work). 

1. $A \cap B$ 
2. $A \cup B$
3. $B \setminus A$ 
4. $A \cup (B \cap C)$ 
5. $(A \cup B) \cap C$ 
6. $|A \times D|$ 

**Success criteria:** All responses are correct up to two simple errors.



### C5

> I can apply the Additive and Multiplicative Principles and the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion to formulate and solve basic combinatorics problems.



For each of these counting problems, identify which of the three principles in the Skill is being applied. Then solve the problem, giving all intermediate steps and a correct, clearly indicated answer. 

1. Sharona is at the store shopping for a new phone. There are 12 different kinds of Android phones for sale, 5 different kinds of iPhones, and 20 different kinds of flip-phones (which are neither Android nor iPhones). No other phones are for sale. She's buying one phone. How many total ways can she make this purchase? 
2. Sharona's sister, Ramona, is at the store with her and is also getting a phone, as well as a case and a charging cable. There are five different kinds of phones she could buy, 38 different cases avilable, and 10 different charging cables. She intends to buy one of each (phone, case, and cable). How many different ways are there for Ramona to make her purchase? 

**Success criteria:** The correct method is identified in each case; the setup and subsequent work is shown; and the answers are correct with up to two simple errors allowed.





### C6

> I can compute factorials and binomial coefficients, and apply these concepts to solve basic combinatorics problems involving permutations, selections, and distributions.



1. Compute the values of each of the following, and show your steps: 

   (a) $8!$

   (b) $\displaystyle{\binom{30}{2}}$    

2. How many 4-element subsets containing the letter A can be formed from the set $\lbrace A, B, C, D, E, F, G \rbrace$?   An example of one such subset would be $\{A, B, F, G\}$, but not $\{A,B,G\}$ (because it doesn't have four elements) and not $\{C,D,E,F\}$ (because it doesn't contain "A"). **On ths part, explain the method you are using and show your work.** 



**Success criteria:** The factorial and binomial coefficient are correct. The counting problem has the method clearly stated, the setup and intermediate work shown, and the answer is correct with up to two simple errors allowed.

## Supplemental Skills 



### S1

> I can convert a positive integer from base 10 to base 2, 8, and 16 and vice versa and represent a negative integer in base 2 using two's complement notation.



1. Convert the base 10 integer $378$ to octal (base 8) using the base conversion algorithm. (On this part, you *must* use the base conversion algorithm and no other method.)
2. Convert the base 16 integer $34B$ to base 10.  
3. Convert the base 2 integer `110011` to base 10. 
4. The 8-bit binary representation of the base 10 integer $32$ is `0010 0000`. Write the 8-bit binary representation of $-32$ using two's complement. 



### S2

> I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide positive integers in base 2.



1. Add the base-2 integers `10011000` and `10001111`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
2. Subtract the base-2 integers `10011000` and `10001111`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
3. Multiply the base-2 integers `1010` and `110`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
4. Divide the base-2 integer `100110` by `11`. **Show your work and circle your answers**. 

**Success criteria:** All, or all but one, of the base conversions must be correct, and conversions from base 10 must involve the base conversion algorithm. The computation of the negative integer using two's complement must be correct and show all the intermediate steps. 

### S3

> I can construct truth tables for propositions involving two or three atomic propositions and use truth tables to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent.



1. Construct a truth table for $(p \vee q) \rightarrow (q \vee (\neg r))$. 
2. Construct truth tables for $\neg(p \wedge q)$ and for $(\neg p) \wedge (\neg q)$. Based on the truth tables, are these two statements logically equivalent? 

**Success criteria:** The first truth table is correct with up to two errors allowed. The truth tables in the second part are correct with up to two errors allowed, and whether the statements are logically equivalent is clearly stated and consistent with the results of the truth tables. 



### S4

> I can determine the truth value of a predicate at a specific input, the truth value of a quantified predicate, and the negation of a quantified predicate.

1. Let $P$ and $Q$ be these two predicates. Assume the domain of each is the set of all natural numbers: $0,1,2,3,4,\dots$ 

   - $P(x)$: The ones digit of $x$ is 3

   - $Q(x)$: $x-10 > 0$ 

     For each of the following, state whether the expression is **TRUE** or whether it is **FALSE**. 

     (a) $P(20)$ 

     (b) $Q(9)$ 

     (c) $\exists x P(x)$ 

     (d) $\forall x (\neg Q(x))$ 

2. Consider the statement: *All electric cars are expensive.* State the negation of this statement, without merely putting the word "not" or the phrase "it is not the case that" in front of the statement; that is, phrase the negation in terms of another quantified statement. 

**Success criteria:** All, or all but one, of the responses are correct. 



### S5

> I can determine elements of a recursively-defined sequence using a recurrence relation.



Consider the sequence of numbers $a_n$ given by the recursive formula $a_0 = 1$, $a_1 = 4$, and for $n > 1$, $a_n = -a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}$. Find the values $a_0$ through $a_5$. Show your work on each calculation. 

**Success criteria:** The first four terms of the sequence are correctly computed with intermediate steps clearly shown; and all, or all but one, of the rest of the terms that are requested are correctly computed.



### S6

> I can derive a recurrence relation for a recursive visual pattern, number sequence, or other sequence of objects.

Consider the following visual pattern. Let $s_n$ be the number of objects in stage $n$ of the pattern with $n = 0$ corresponding to the first stage.  

![Visual pattern](https://i.ibb.co/0M3jvqR/sample-cp-0.png)

1. State the value of $s_0$. 
2. Give a correct recurrence relation that defines $s_n$, the number of objects in stage $n$ of the pattern. Briefly explain your reasoning. 

**Success criteria:** The initial condition or conditions are clearly stated, and the recurrence relation is clearly and correctly stated *and* has a brief explanation for how it was obtained.



### S7

> I can determine if a mapping is a function; identify the domain, range, and codomain of a function; and determine the image of a specific input in one function or a composition of functions.



Below are six mappings. For each one: 

- State whether the mapping is a function or whether it is not a function. 
- If the mapping is a function, state its domain, range, and codomain. Phrase each one as a set using correct notation and syntax and make sure to label which one is which. 

![](https://i.ibb.co/SVhfwxX/lt10-cp13.png)

**Success criteria:** All mappings are correctly identified as functions or non-functions. For the ones that are functions, all (or all but one) have the domain, codomain, and range clearly and correctly stated.





### S8

> I can determine if a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.



For each of the functions below, state whether the function is *injective but not surjective*, *surjective but not injective*, *neither injective nor surjective*, or *bjective*. (Note that every function must fall into exactly one of these categories.) If a function **DOES HAVE** a property, you **DO NOT ** have to explain why; just state it. (For example "$F$ is injective".) If a function **DOES NOT HAVE** a property (for example if the function is not surjective) then **give a specific, concrete example where the property fails**. 

1. The function $f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ given by the formula $f(x) = 3x + 2$. (Reminder, $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of all real numbers.)
2. The function $g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ given by the formula $g(n) = 3n+2$. (Reminder, $\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,4,\dots\}$)
3. The function shown as #6 in the problem for Skill S7 above (in the lower-right of the grid).

**Success criteria:** At least two of the three functions are correctly labeled. And, all instances of failure to have a property are accompanied by a correct, specific, concrete example that shows the property fails. 



### S9

> I can determine if a sequence of numbers is arithmetic or geometric and derive both closed-form and recursive formulas for them.



Below are four integer sequences. Label each one as **arithmetic**, **geometric**, or **neither** (if the sequence is neither arithmetic nor geometric). If a sequence is either arithmetic or geometric. give both a closed formula and a complete recursive definition for the sequence. You do not need to show your work but your answers must be complete and correct. **Assume that the starting index is $0$.** 

1. $4, 3.9, 3.8, 3.7, \dots$
2. $1, 5, 25, 125, \dots$ 
3. $8, 6, 4, 2, \dots$
4. $$4, 8, 12, 20, 32, 52, \dots$$ 

**Success criteria:** All sequences are correctly labeled. Of the ones that are either geometric or arithmetic, all (or all but one) of the closed formulas and recurrence relations are correctly stated, and have consistent indexing.





### S10 

> I can use the characteristic root method to find a closed-form solution for a first- or second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation. 



Consider the recurrence relation defined for $n \geq 2$:

$$a_n = -3a_{n-1} + 10 a_{n-2}$$

with initial conditions $a_0 = 2$  and $a_1 = 3$. **Note the negative sign in front of the 3.**

Solve the recurrence relation using the characteristic root method.

**Success criteria:** The characteristic equation and characteristic roots are correct. The remainder of the solution shows all intermediate steps in a clear order, and the final answer is correct up to one simple error.
