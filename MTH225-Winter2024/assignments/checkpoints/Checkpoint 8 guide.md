# Checkpoint 8 guide

**Note about Skills S1 and S2:**  From now on, these guides will not contain answers or common mistakes for Skills S1 or S2. At this point very few, if any students are reattempting these skills; and if you are attempting them, you can easily check your work with an online calculator. 

## Skill S3

## Skill S4

## Skill S5

## Skill S6

## Skill S7

1. Not a function (because $o$ maps to two things)
2. Function. Domain = $\lbrace 8,0,9,4,3 \rbrace$. Codomain = $\lbrace 7,0,8,3,6 \rbrace$. Range = $\lbrace 7,8,3\rbrace$. 
3. Not a function (because $4$ maps to two things)
4. Not a function (because $j$ maps to two things)
5. Function. Domain = $\lbrace m,y,n \rbrace$. Codomain = $\lbrace r,g,k,s \rbrace$. Range = $\lbrace g,k,s \rbrace$.
6. Not a function (because $l$ doesn't map to anything) 

## Skill S8

1. This function is a bijection. 
2. This function is neither injective nor surjective. It's not injective because for example, `1011` and `0011` both map to `0011`. It's not surjective because none of the bits that start with a `1`, such as `1111`, can be hit. 
3. This function is injective, but not surjective. It's not surjective because $-1$ has no corresponding input, in fact none of the negative integers do. 

### Common mistakes

- **Stating that the function in item 2 is surjective:** It's not, see above for the reasons. 
- - **Stating that the function in item 2 is injective:** It's not, see above for the reasons.
