*Note*: Explanations are provided for part 1. These are not required for your work; they're only here for study purposes so you can see why the statements are true or false. 

1. (a) False (because $9^2 = 81$ which is not greater than 100)

   (b) True (because $9^3 = 729$)

   (c) False (because part (a) is a counterexample)

   (d) True (because there does exist an $x$ such that $x^3$ is not odd, for example $x=2$)

2. *No dogs are poodles*  (Note, this isn't the same as "putting 'not' or 'it is not the case that' in front of the statement. If it's too close for comfort you could also say something like *All dogs are non-poodles*.)

### Common mistakes

- **Stating that "Some dogs are not poodles" as the negation:** The statement "Some dogs are not poodles" is not the negation of "Some dogs are poodles" because both of those statements are true at the same time.

- $a_2 = 2a_1 + a_0 = 2 \cdot 5 + 2 = 12$
- $a_3 = 2a_2 + a_1 = 2 \cdot 12 + 5 = 29$ 
- $a_4 = 2a_3 + a_2 = 2 \cdot 29 + 12 = 70$
- $a_5 = 2a_4 + a_3 = 2 \cdot 70 + 29 = 169$  
- $a_6 = 2a_5 + a_4 = 2 \cdot 169 + 70 = 408$
- $a_7 = 2a_6 + a_5 = 2 \cdot 408 + 169 = 985$
