## C1

Original statement: *If the rug is dirty, then it should be vacuumed.* 

1. The rug is dirty
2. The rug should be vacuumed
3. If the rug needs to be vacuumed, then it's dirty.
4. If the rug doesn't need to be vacuumed, then it isn't dirty.
5. If the rug is not dirty, then it shouldn't be vacuumed.
6. The rug is dirty but it does not need to be vacuumed. 


## C2

Proposition: For every integer $n \geq 1$, the number $3^n - 1$ is a multiple of $2$.

1. The predicate $P(n)$ is "$3^n - 1$ is a multiple of $2$.".
2. $n=1$
3. Suppose $n=1$. Then $3^n - 1 = 3^1 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$. This is a multiple of $2$ (since $2= 2 \times 1$) so the base case holds. 
4. Assume that for some integer $k>1$, $3^k - 1$ is a multiple of $2$.
5. Prove that $3^{k+1} - 1$ is a multiple of $2$.
