## S5

Given: $a_0 = 0, a_1 = 2, a_2 = 2$. 

$a_3 = a_2 + 3a_0 = 2 + 3(0) = 2$
 
$a_4 = a_3 + 3a_1 = 2 + 3(2) = 8$

$a_5 = a_4 + 3a_2 = 8 + 3(2) = 14$

$a_6 = a_5 + 3a_3 = 14 + 3(2) = 20$

$a_7 = a_6 + 3a_4 = 20 + 3(8) = 44$

### Common mistakes

- **Only going back two steps in the recurrence relation instead of three:** The recurrence relation is $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3a_{n-3}$, so three steps back are required. Several only went back two,and computed $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3a_{n-2}$.
