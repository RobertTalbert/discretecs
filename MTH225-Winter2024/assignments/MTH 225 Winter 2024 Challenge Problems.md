# Challenge Problems -- MTH 225 Winter 2024 

## General notes about these problems 

- You do not need to work every single one of these problems. A grade of "A" in the course requires ten (10)  Successful solutions; a "B" requires six (6); a "C" requires two (2). Choose problems that appeal to your curiosity and interest. 
- You are to submit **typewritten** solutions that are **clear, correct, and complete**. Please see the Standards for Student Work document for details on the criteria on what these mean. 
- Your solution **must represent your ideas, that you yourself generated, and must be given in your own voice**. They cannot significantly consist of ideas from another person or from an artificial intelligence tool, and they must be given in your own words. Violations of this policy will be investigated as academic misconduct. See the syllabus for the full policy. 
- Challenge Problem submissions are graded "Success" or "Retry". Perfection is not required for "Success", but your solutions need to be free of major errors, and consist of complete good-faith efforts that are clearly communicated. Again, see the Standards for Student Work document for details on the criteria used to determine "Success". 
- Generally speaking, **your grade on a Challenge Problem is based on the quality of the explanation you give, not the correctness of answers.** Strive to make sure your solutions are correct, clear, and complete relative to the standard audience for these solutions. 
- If you receive a "Success" mark on a submission, you are done with that problem. Otherwise ("Retry") you may submit a revision at any time, through April 14. 
- **You are allowed up to three (3) Challenge Problem submissions per week**: Three new solutions, three revisions, or any combination of new solutions and revisions. 

Also, generally speaking **I (Talbert) will not "look over" your work before it's submitted to look for mathematical, logical, or other errors**. Just do your best, give a complete good-faith effort, and if a revision is needed, you'll have the opportunity to do so with detailed feedback from me and without any penalty.

## Problem List 

### Problem 1

1. If $n$ is any positive integer, what is the binary representation for $2^n$? Give an answer to this question that is specific and clear as possible, then *explain why your answer is correct*. 
2. If $a$ is any positive integer, suppose you convert it to binary and then add it to itself. How does the binary form of the result compare to the binary form of $a$, the original integer? Give an answer to this question that is specific and clear as possible, then *explain why your answer is correct*.
3. In [the video about the base 10 conversion algorithm](https://vimeo.com/578187581), it was stated that we can use that algorithm to convert a decimal integer into *any* base, not just base 2, 8, or 16. [Go to this website](https://numbergenerator.org/random-6-digit-number-generator) and generate a random 6-digit integer in base 10. Then use the algorithm to convert this integer into **base 20**. See below for a mini-explanation of base 20. Show all your work and explain what you're doing. 

**Mini-tutorial on base 20**: A number in base 20 is written as a sum of powers of 20. For example, if $(371)_{20}$ is in base 20, then in base 10 this is...
$$(3 \times 20^2) + (7 \times 20^1) + (1 \times 20^0) = 1200 + 140 + 1 =  1341$$
In base 16 we had to expand our set of digits we could use, adding the letters A-F to the usual digits 0-9. In base 20, we could have place values from 0 to 19, so we need to add more digits. For this, we use the usual 0-9 and the letters A, B, C, D, E, F **and the letters G, H, I, and J** to represent 16, 17, 18, and 19. So for example, the integer J6GA in base 20 when converted to base 10 is
$$J6GA = (19 \times 20^3) + (6 \times 20^2)+ (16 \times 20^1) + (10 \times 20^0) = 154730.$$
Likewise, the decimal number $2052$ is $52C$ in base 20 (which you can check using the algorithm!).

**Notes and requirements:** In addition to the usual criteria for successful work found in the [Standards for Student Work document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2024/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20W24.md), please note: 

- Your explanations in the first two parts cannot consist only of examples. Remember, examples do not explain why a general statement is always true. Give an explanation that does not rely on any specific choice of the integer. 
- You may also not just give a few more examples and say something like "The pattern continues" or "Every other integer works the same way". This is too reliant upon specific examples.
