Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 10.3
=========================================

## Overview 

In previous lessons on trees, we've looked at ways to organize and store information in various kinds of tree structures. In this lesson, we learn about how to get information _out_ of a tree structure by _traversing_ the tree -- visiting the nodes of the tree one at a time in a particular order. As a result, we can convert a tree into an ordered list. The three ways of traversing a tree -- _preorder_, _postorder_, and _inorder_ traversals -- return data in different orders that suit different needs. As a particular application, we'll touch on ways to _parse_ mathematical expressions as trees and then traverse the tree to produce a calculation. 

## Learning Objectives in this section

+ CC.33: Perform preorder, postorder, and inorder traversals of an ordered rooted tree. 
+ M.30: Represent and evalaute a mathematical expression in infix, prefix, and postfix notation. 

## Resources for learning

First, __watch__ [this video on binary tree traversal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8DUJJhmY4). It is 14 minutes 28 seconds long. If you don't have the time, don't like the video, or want more examples, a YouTube query on tree traversals will yield several more results. But this seems to be the most comprehensive one. 

After you watch the video, there are two other items to help you learn about traversals. Try to do at least one of these, preferably both.

+ Go to your textbook and __work through__ Example 2 (preorder traversal), Example 3 (inorder), and Example 4 (postorder). What you should do is try to do the traversals yourself first using the information from the video, and then check your work and correct your errors using the examples. 
+ Go to this website: [http://btv.melezinek.cz/binary-search-tree.html](http://btv.melezinek.cz/binary-search-tree.html) The website will generate a random binary search tree, and you can animate all three of the traversals done in this section. Under "Algorithms" click the `RandomBSTree` button. To watch an animation of a preorder traversal, click the `To Preorder Array` button; similarly for postorder or inorder traversal. Pro tip: It helps to slide the `Speed of Move` slider up to about 3/4 of the way to the right and `Duration of a Step` slider to about 1/4 of the way to the left to make the animations go a little faster. 

Then go and work through the activities. Once you're done __skim__ the rest of this section to see what other items we'll be talking about in class. 

## Activities 

Here is a binary search tree (generated using the website from the Resources section):

1. List the nodes in the order in which they would be visited in a preorder traversal of the tree. 
2. List the nodes in the order in which they would be visited in an inorder traversal of the tree. 
3. List the nodes in the order in which they would be visited in an postorder traversal of the tree. 
4. Which of the three traversals produces a list that is actually in numerical order?
