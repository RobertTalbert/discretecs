<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section we will introduce the concept of the <em>equivalence relation</em>, which is a special kind of relation used in many ways and applications. An equivalence relation models common relations among real-world objects, such as the &quot;equality&quot; relation, or the &quot;less than or equal to&quot; relation on real numbers, of &quot;subset of&quot; relation on sets. After defining what an equivalence relation is, we will look at examples and nonexamples, and then discuss the related notion of <em>equivalence classes</em> and see how equivalence classes can be used to partition sets.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.6: State the definitions of the following terms: Equivalence relation; equivalence class; partition of a set.</li>
<li>CC.7: Given an equivalence relation on a set A, determine if two elements of A belong to the same equivalence class.</li>
<li>M.8 (CORE): Determine whether a relation on a set is an equivalence relation.</li>
<li>M.9 (CORE): Given an equivalence relation on a set A and a point x in A, determine the equivalence class of x.</li>
<li>M.10: Given an equivalence relation on a set, determine a partition of the set using the equivalence relation. Conversely, given a partition of a set, use it to define an equivalence relation on that set.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for learning</h2>
<p>For basic preparation, please read <strong>all of Section 8.5</strong> in the Rosen textbook.</p>
<p>Here are some other resources that can supplement your basic reading:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFXgXYCzXB4">This video about equivalence relations</a> (running time 14:02) is one that I (Talbert) made for MTH 210, &quot;Communicating in Mathematics&quot; which is a course for math majors. As such, some of the notation and textbook references may not be familiar, but you should be able to get something out of it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>As always, work out the activities below in your notes for future reference and questions. Then go to the submission form at:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1ClnvHz">http://bit.ly/1ClnvHz</a></p>
<p>and put your answers in the indicated areas. There is a link to a Google Form at which you can leave and upvote any questions you have on what you've read and worked with; your answers will help set the agenda for the class meeting.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let <span class="math"><em>A</em></span> be the set of all people in the world. At the submission form, you will find five relations on this set. Check all the ones you believe are equivalence relations.</li>
<li>Go back to that list of relations on the set of all people and look at the ones that <em>weren't</em> equivalence relations. For each one, list the property or properties of an equivalence relation that <em>fail</em> to hold.</li>
<li>Consider the set of all URLs (or web addresses). Define a relation <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> on this set by declaring <span class="math">(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) ∈ <em>R</em></span> if and only if the website that comes up when you enter in <span class="math"><em>x</em></span> in a web browser is the same as the website that comes up when you enter in <span class="math"><em>y</em></span> in a web browser. It can be shown (not now; but you should think about it) that this is an equivalence relation. What do you think is the practical significance of the equivalence class of a URL in this relation? (A 2--3 sentence response that answers the question is sufficient. You might begin by thinking of a website that can be accessed by more than one URL -- for example <a href="http://learningcatalytics.com">http://learningcatalytics.com</a> and <a href="http://lcatalytics.com">http://lcatalytics.com</a>.)</li>
