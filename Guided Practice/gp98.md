Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 9.8
========================================

## Overview 

Earlier in the semester, we asked a question about _coloring_ the nodes of a graph. Namely, suppose you wanted to color the nodes of a graph using a certain number of colors, so that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. How many colors would you need? In this section, we take up this idea in full detail and discuss _graph coloring_ problems, the _chromatic number_ of a graph, and the surprising range of applications of graph coloring to real-world problems. This is a two-day unit; day 1 will focus on calculating the chromatic number of a graph, while day 2 will focus on applications. 

## Learning Objectives in this section

+ CC.27: State the definitions of the following terms: Coloring of a simple graph; chromatic number of a graph. 
+ CC.28: Given a simple graph, find a coloring of the graph using a specified number of colors. 
+ CC.29: State the Four Color Theorem. 
+ M.24 (CORE): Determine the chromatic number of a graph. 
+ M.25: Apply graph coloring to problems in scheduling and other related areas.

## Resources for learning

First of all, in your textbook: 

+ Read pages 667 through 671, paying particular attention to the examples of computation of the chromatic number. 
+ Read Example 5 carefully, where graph coloring is applied to scheduling final exams. 
+ Skim through the remainder of the section about applications of graph colorings; you'll be working with applications in class as well as in learning modules. 

Then, on Sage, play around with the code located here: [https://gist.github.com/RobertTalbert/9389b95826f757dbd3ec](https://gist.github.com/RobertTalbert/9389b95826f757dbd3ec). Try some random graphs for $g$ and then try some graphs that you enter in yourself, as matrices or dictionaries. You can also try special graphs, for example `g = graphs.FlowerSnark()`. 

## Activities 

1. What is the chromatic number of the following graph?

Here's a link if the inline image doesn't show up correctly: [http://www.screencast.com/t/Rf813gpRwM](http://www.screencast.com/t/Rf813gpRwM). Figure this out by hand first, and then check your work by entering the graph into Sage as a dictionary and using the graph coloring code posted on Github. 

2. What does the Four Color Theorem say, and how was it proven? Write no more than 280 characters (= two tweets). Do a little internet research if you need to. 

3. Suppose a graph has a chromatic number of 5. What, if anything, can we conclude about it? On the submission form, there is a checklist of options; check all that apply and be ready to explain your answer when we open up the class meeting.
