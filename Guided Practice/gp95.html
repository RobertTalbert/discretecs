<h1 id="guided-practice-for-mth-325-section-9.5">Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 9.5</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section, we will tackle two questions about connected graphs that have suprising applications to real life problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>When is it possible in a connected graph to make a circuit that uses every edge in the graph, and uses each edge only once?</li>
<li>When is it possible in a connected graph to make a circuit that uses every node in the graph, and uses each node only once?</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a snow plow that needs to plow each street in a neighborhood but never plow the same street twice, and end up where it started, would be making a circuit of the first kind. A person who wants to take a tour of Grand Rapids craft breweries and visit each one, but never visit the same one twice, and end up where he started would be making a circuit of the second kind. The first kind of circuit is called an <em>Euler circuit</em> and the second kind a <em>Hamilton circuit</em>, after the mathematicians who first studied them. In the section, we'll be coming up with mathematical results that tell us exactly when graphs have these kinds of circuits. Day 1 will focus on Euler circuits, day 2 on Hamilton circuits.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.21: State the definitions of the following terms: Euler circuit; Euler path; Hamilton path; Hamilton circuit.</li>
<li>CC.22: State Dirac's Theorem and Ore's Theorem.</li>
<li>CC.23: State whether a given path or circuit in a graph is Eulerian or Hamiltonian.</li>
<li>M.20 (CORE): Determine whether a graph (directed or undirected) has an Euler path or an Euler circuit, or a Hamilton path or Hamilton circuit.</li>
<li>M.21 (CORE): Use Dirac's Theorem and Ore's Theorem to draw conclusions about the existence of Hamilton circuits.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want you to do something a little different this time for preparation for this section: <strong>Don't read the entire section.</strong> If you do, it will give away spoilers for the activities that we will do in class. Instead, ONLY read the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of Euler circuits and Euler paths on page 633; then study (don't just read!) Examples 1 and 2 that follow.</li>
<li>The definition of Hamilton circuits and Hamilton paths on page 638; then study (don't just read!) Examples 5, 6, and 7 that follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you've read the definitions and studied the examples, and have a strong grasp on what Euler and Hamilton circuits/paths are (and what they are not), you're ready for the activities below.</p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>As always, work out the activities below in your notes for future reference and questions. Then go to the submission form at:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1zZdcYR">http://bit.ly/1zZdcYR</a></p>
<p>and put your answers in the indicated areas. There is a link to a Google Form at which you can leave and upvote any questions you have on what you've read and worked with; your answers will help set the agenda for the class meeting.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider the graph shown here: <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/fMvjjZQB">http://www.screencast.com/t/fMvjjZQB</a> Does this graph have an Euler <em>circuit</em>? If so, type in the Euler circuit as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not. (Question for you that might come up: Can an Euler circuit visit a node in the graph more than once?)</li>
<li>Does the graph in question 1 have an Euler <em>path</em> (that is not a circuit)? If so, type in the Euler path as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not.</li>
<li>Now consider this graph: <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/dd7YgL6qo">http://www.screencast.com/t/dd7YgL6qo</a> Does this graph have an Euler circuit? If so, type in the Euler circuit as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not.</li>
