<h1 id="guided-practice-for-mth-325-section-9.2">Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 9.2</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section we expand on our basic notions of graphs in three ways. First, we introduce some important terminology for graphs, including the concept of the <em>degree</em> of a vertex and related ideas for directed graphs. Second, we establish three basic mathematical results about undirected graphs, the most important of which is the <em>Handshaking Theorem</em> (Theorem 1 in this section) which specifies a relationship between the number of edges in a graph and the degrees of the vertices in the graph. Third, we introduce some special families of graphs (<em>complete</em>, <em>cycle</em>, <em>wheel</em>, and <em>n-cube</em> graphs as well as <em>bipartite</em> graphs) that are useful in theory and in applications.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.12: State the definitions of the following terms: Adjacent nodes; incident; degree of a vertex in an undirected graph; initial and terminal vertices of a directed edge; in-degree and out-degree of a vertex in a digraph; complete graph on n vertices; cycle graph; wheel graph; n-cube graph; bipartite graph; complete bipartite graph; subgraph.</li>
<li>CC.13: Given an undirected graph, determine if two nodes are adjacent; determine if an edge is incident with two nodes; and find the degree of a vertex.</li>
<li>CC.14: Given a directed graph, determine if two notes are adjacent from each other; and find the in- and out-degree of a vertex.</li>
<li>CC.15: Draw examples of the cycle, wheel, n-cube, and complete bipartite graphs.</li>
<li>CC.16: State the Handshaking Theorem and Theorem 2.</li>
<li>M.14: Explain how the Handshaking Theorem is proven and how it is used to prove Theorem 2.</li>
<li>M.15 (CORE): Use the Handshaking Theorem and Theorem 2 to draw conclusions about edges and nodes in a graph.</li>

<p>For basic preparation, please read <strong>all of Section 9.2</strong> in the Rosen textbook.</p>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>As always, work out the activities below in your notes for future reference and questions. Then go to the submission form at:</p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1DxZhIv">http://bit.ly/1DxZhIv</a></p>
<p>and put your answers in the indicated areas. There is a link to a Google Form at which you can leave and upvote any questions you have on what you've read and worked with; your answers will help set the agenda for the class meeting.</p>
<p>Before doing the exercises below, you'll need to try out some new commands in Sage. Open up a Sage notebook and enter the following:</p>
<pre><code>g = graphs.RandomGNM(10,15)
g.show()</code></pre>
<p>This will generate a random graph with 10 nodes and 15 edges, then display it. Now try the following <em>in a separate cell</em> so that the <code>g</code> graph above isn't re-created:</p>
<pre><code>g.degree(1)</code></pre>
<p>Look at your graph and see if you can tell what this command does. (Hint: Remind yourself of the definition of &quot;degree&quot; of a vertex first.) Then try entering</p>
<pre><code>g.degree()</code></pre>
<p>without something in the parenthesis, and see what this does.</p>
<p>Now let's see how Sage can generate some of the graphs you read about in the section. Try entering:</p>
<pre><code>g = graphs.CompleteGraph(5)
g.show() </code></pre>
<p>For fun, replace the 5 with something larger! Then try:</p>
<pre><code>g = graphs.CycleGraph(5)
g.show()</code></pre>
<p>Now try:</p>
<pre><code>g = graphs.WheelGraph(5)
g.show()</code></pre>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Compare the output here to the graph of <span class="math"><em>W</em><sub>5</sub></span> on page 601 and notice that these are <em>not</em> the same graph. You'll need to beware when using Sage to work with wheel graphs, since Sage and your book don't agree on the terminology. Finally, try:</p>
<pre><code>g = graphs.CubeGraph(3)
g.show()</code></pre>
<p>For a head rush, replace the 3 with something larger.</p>
<p>You now know how to use Sage to generate a random graph; find the degree of a particular node; generate a list of the degrees of all the nodes in a graph; and how to generate complete, wheel, cycle, and cube graphs. Now you are ready to work on the exercises.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The n-cube graph (see page 602, or your Sage work from above) has <span class="math">2<sup><em>n</em></sup></span> nodes, each labelled by a unique bitstring of length <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>. What is the degree of each of these nodes? On the form, state your answer (in terms of <span class="math"><em>n</em></span>) and give a one sentence (or less) explanation.</li>
<li>The 10-cube graph is a specific instance of the n-cube graph. It has <span class="math">2<sup>10</sup> = 1024</span> nodes (each labelled with a bitstring of length 10), which makes it hard to visualize even with a computer (although you are welcome to try). How many <em>edges</em> does the 10-cube graph have? Figure this out in Sage and paste the code you use into the box at the form. There are at least two ways to do this -- and in class we'll discuss both ways and why they are equivalent.</li>
<li>Consider the <em>directed</em> graph show <a href="http://goo.gl/niznKx">here</a>. State the in-degree and out-degree of each node. Can you figure out a way to determine the in- and out-degrees of the nodes using Sage? If so, explain how you did it.</li>
