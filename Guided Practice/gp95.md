Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 9.5
========================================

## Overview 

In this section, we will tackle two questions about connected graphs that have suprising applications to real life problems:

+ When is it possible in a connected graph to make a circuit that uses every edge in the graph, and uses each edge only once? 
+ When is it possible in a connected graph to make a circuit that uses every node in the graph, and uses each node only once? 

For example, a snow plow that needs to plow each street in a neighborhood but never plow the same street twice, and end up where it started, would be making a circuit of the first kind. A person who wants to take a tour of Grand Rapids craft breweries and visit each one, but never visit the same one twice, and end up where he started would be making a circuit of the second kind. The first kind of circuit is called an _Euler circuit_ and the second kind a _Hamilton circuit_, after the mathematicians who first studied them. In the section, we'll be coming up with mathematical results that tell us exactly when graphs have these kinds of circuits. Day 1 will focus on Euler circuits,  day 2 on Hamilton circuits. 

## Learning Objectives in this section

+ CC.21: State the definitions of the following terms: Euler circuit; Euler path; Hamilton path; Hamilton circuit. 
+ CC.22: State Dirac's Theorem and Ore's Theorem. 
+ CC.23: State whether a given path or circuit in a graph is Eulerian or Hamiltonian. 
+ M.20 (CORE): Determine whether a graph (directed or undirected) has an Euler path or an Euler circuit, or a Hamilton path or Hamilton circuit. 
+ M.21 (CORE): Use Dirac's Theorem and Ore's Theorem to draw conclusions about the existence of Hamilton circuits. 

## Resources for learning

I want you to do something a little different this time for preparation for this section: __Don't read the entire section.__ If you do, it will give away spoilers for the activities that we will do in class. Instead, ONLY read the following: 

+ The definition of Euler circuits and Euler paths on page 633; then study (don't just read!) Examples 1 and 2 that follow. 
+ The definition of Hamilton circuits and Hamilton paths on page 638; then study (don't just read!) Examples 5, 6, and 7 that follow. 

Once you've read the definitions and studied the examples, and have a strong grasp on what Euler and Hamilton circuits/paths are (and what they are not), you're ready for the activities below. 

## Activities 

As always, work out the activities below in your notes for future reference and questions. Then go to the submission form at: 

[http://bit.ly/1zZdcYR](http://bit.ly/1zZdcYR)

and put your answers in the indicated areas. There is a link to a Google Form at which you can leave and upvote any questions you have on what you've read and worked with; your answers will help set the agenda for the class meeting. 

1. Consider the graph shown here: [http://www.screencast.com/t/fMvjjZQB](http://www.screencast.com/t/fMvjjZQB)  Does this graph have an Euler _circuit_? If so, type in the Euler circuit as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not. (Question for you that might come up: Can an Euler circuit visit a node in the graph more than once?)
2. Does the graph in question 1 have an Euler _path_ (that is not a circuit)? If so, type in the Euler path as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not.
3. Now consider this graph: [http://www.screencast.com/t/dd7YgL6qo](http://www.screencast.com/t/dd7YgL6qo) Does this graph have an Euler circuit? If so, type in the Euler circuit as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not. 
4. Does the graph in question 3 have an Euler _path_ (that is not a circuit)? If so, type in the Euler path as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not.
5. Now consider this graph: [http://www.screencast.com/t/ap4oP4ODc3BS](http://www.screencast.com/t/ap4oP4ODc3BS) Does this graph have a Hamilton circuit? If so, type in the Euler circuit as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not.
6. Finally, consider this graph: [http://www.screencast.com/t/HT1Wk7Z9RDl6](http://www.screencast.com/t/HT1Wk7Z9RDl6) Does this graph have a Hamilton circuit? If so, type in the Euler circuit as a sequence of nodes into the text box. If not, enter in a one-sentence explanation of why not.
