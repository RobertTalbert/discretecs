<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In previous lessons on trees, we've looked at ways to organize and store information in various kinds of tree structures. In this lesson, we learn about how to get information <em>out</em> of a tree structure by <em>traversing</em> the tree -- visiting the nodes of the tree one at a time in a particular order. As a result, we can convert a tree into an ordered list. The three ways of traversing a tree -- <em>preorder</em>, <em>postorder</em>, and <em>inorder</em> traversals -- return data in different orders that suit different needs. As a particular application, we'll touch on ways to <em>parse</em> mathematical expressions as trees and then traverse the tree to produce a calculation.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.33: Perform preorder, postorder, and inorder traversals of an ordered rooted tree.</li>
<li>M.30: Represent and evalaute a mathematical expression in infix, prefix, and postfix notation.</li>
</ul>

<p>First, <strong>watch</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8DUJJhmY4">this video on binary tree traversal</a>. It is 14 minutes 28 seconds long. If you don't have the time, don't like the video, or want more examples, a YouTube query on tree traversals will yield several more results. But this seems to be the most comprehensive one.</p>
<p>After you watch the video, there are two other items to help you learn about traversals. Try to do at least one of these, preferably both.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your textbook and <strong>work through</strong> Example 2 (preorder traversal), Example 3 (inorder), and Example 4 (postorder). What you should do is try to do the traversals yourself first using the information from the video, and then check your work and correct your errors using the examples.</li>
<li>Go to this website: <a href="http://btv.melezinek.cz/binary-search-tree.html">http://btv.melezinek.cz/binary-search-tree.html</a> The website will generate a random binary search tree, and you can animate all three of the traversals done in this section. Under &quot;Algorithms&quot; click the <code>RandomBSTree</code> button. To watch an animation of a preorder traversal, click the <code>To Preorder Array</code> button; similarly for postorder or inorder traversal. Pro tip: It helps to slide the <code>Speed of Move</code> slider up to about 3/4 of the way to the right and <code>Duration of a Step</code> slider to about 1/4 of the way to the left to make the animations go a little faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then go and work through the activities. Once you're done <strong>skim</strong> the rest of this section to see what other items we'll be talking about in class.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>List the nodes in the order in which they would be visited in a preorder traversal of the tree.</li>
<li>List the nodes in the order in which they would be visited in an inorder traversal of the tree.</li>
<li>List the nodes in the order in which they would be visited in an postorder traversal of the tree.</li>
<li>Which of the three traversals produces a list that is actually in numerical order?</li>
