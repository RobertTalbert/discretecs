Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 10.4
=========================================

## Overview 

We return in this lesson to graphs to relate them back to trees. Given a graph, we'd like to find a _spanning tree_ for the graph -- a tree that has all the same nodes as the original graph but none of the cycles. Spanning trees are a "skeleton" of the original graph and provide a means of determining whether the graph is connected. Constructing a spanning tree in a graph involves two forms of _search_ algorithms in the graph: _depth-first_ and _breadth-first_, both of which are valuable applications in their own right.

## Learning Objectives in this section

+ CC.34: State the definition of the term _spanning tree_ and identify whether a subgraph of a given graph is or is not a spanning tree. 
+ M.31 (CORE): Find a spanning tree within a graph using depth-first and breadth-first search. 

## Resources for learning

1. __Watch__ this 10-minute video that describes depth- and breadth-first search: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZhSSXAwxI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZhSSXAwxI).
2. __Play__ with these two computer simulations: [Breadth-first search](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BFS.html), [Depth-first search](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html). On these, be sure to select "undirected graph". You can slow down or speed up the animation using the slider at the _bottom_ of the window, or step through the search process manually. 
3. __Focus__ in the textbook on pages 724 through 725 (and the top of page 726) where there is a discussion of _spanning trees_. 

If after watching the video and playing with the simulations, you are still unclear on breadth- and depth-first searches, try doing a YouTube query for more video content (there is much more available); or searching Google for relevant text material such as lecture notes and handouts. 

Finally: __Skim__ the rest of Section 10.3 in the textbook for more descriptions of depth- and breadth-first search. 

## Activities 

Here is a nice connected graph:

By Theorem 1 of this section, since the graph is connected, it must have a spanning tree. 

1. Find a spanning tree for this graph that is obtained through a depth-first search starting at node 0. State your answer as a Python dictionary. 
2. Find a spanning tree for this graph that is obtained through a breadth-first search starting at node 0. State your answer as a Python dictionary.
3. Unrelated to the graph above: Is it possible for a graph to have more than one possible spanning tree? If so, give an example of a graph and two spanning trees for it; keep the example as simple as you can. If not, explain why not.
