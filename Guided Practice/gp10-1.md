Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 10.1
=========================================

## Overview 

This lesson kicks off a study of the final Big Idea in discrete structures, namely the concept of a _tree_. Trees are a particular kind of graph that are of central importance and usefulness in computer science in applications ranging from networking to search algorithms to logistics. In this lesson we will be introducing the basic concepts and terminology behind trees, along with a few simple applications. 

## Learning Objectives in this section

+ CC.30: State the definitions of the following terms: tree, rooted tree; m-ary (and binary) tree; full m-ary tree. 
+ CC.31: Given a tree, do the following: Determine its root, if it has one; Given a node in the tree, determine its parent and all of its children, siblings, and descendants, and determine whether the node is a leaf or an internal vertex; and state whether the tree is m-ary or full m-ary for some integer m. 
+ CC.32: Given a binary tree and a node, find the left and right children of that node and the left and right subtrees at those children.
+ M.26: Use trees to model various kinds of networks. 
+ M.27: Use the formulas in the "Properties of Trees" subsection to draw conclusions about the edges and nodes in a tree.

## Resources for learning

In your textbook, do the following: 

+ __FOCUS__ on the text from page 683 through 687, especially the terminology and the examples that flesh out the terminology. Note that if you have studied trees in another course (e.g. CIS 263) you might encounter some differences in terminology and notation. 
+ __LIGHTLY READ__ the text from pages 688 through 690 on "Trees as Models" to get a feel for applications of trees. 
+ __SKIM__ the text through the rest of the section on "Properties of Trees". We will use class time to focus on this end of the section, but you'll benefit from having a sense of what's here prior to your arrival at class. 

## Activities 

(1) Consider the graph shown below:

(Direct link: [http://www.screencast.com/t/9e7oruEtHU6M](http://www.screencast.com/t/9e7oruEtHU6M)) In this graph, there are two different simple paths from node 6 to node 10. One of those is the edge that connects 6 and 10 directly; find the other one. What does the existence of two different simple paths between two nodes tell you about whether the graph is a tree or not? 

(2) Definition 3 defines an "$m$-ary tree" where $m$ is a natural number. Of particular interest to computer scientists are _binary trees_. These are $m$-ary trees where $m=2$. At the submission form, rewrite the first two sentences of Definition 3, replacing the word "$m$-ary" with the word "binary" and all remaining instances of the variable $m$ with the number 2. The modified definition would start off: "A rooted tree is called a _binary tree_ if..." 

(3) Here is a _rooted tree_ (see the text for the definition of that term) whose root is node 5:

(Direct link: [http://www.screencast.com/t/36F0wuWR](http://www.screencast.com/t/36F0wuWR)) At the submission form, there are several questions for you to answer that involve identifying special nodes within this graph. Answer those questions on the submission form.
