Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 10.5
=========================================

## Overview 

First of all, congratulations -- we've made it to the end of the content of this course. This lesson and this Guided Practice assignment are the last ones you'll see this semester. 

In this lesson, we will extend our concept of spanning trees to look at spanning trees in a _weighted_ graph -- this time with an eye toward finding a spanning tree of minimum total weight. This is a little like Dijkstra's Algorithm, except we are not finding just the shortest _path_ between two nodes but the "shortest" spanning tree. The two algorithms are _Prim's Algorithm_ and _Kruskal's Algorithm_, and both will find a minimum spanning tree for a graph using different approaches. 

## Learning Objectives in this section

+ CC.35: State the definition of the term _minimum spanning tree_ and identify whether a subgraph of a weighted graph is or is not a minimum spanning tree. 
+ M.32 (CORE): Find a minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph using Prim's algorithm. 
+ M.33 (CORE): Find a minimum spanning tree in a connected weighted graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

## Resources for learning

Here is a recommended list of resources to use for this section, and an order in which to use them: 

1. First, __focus__ on the introduction to section 10.5, up to and including the paragraph following the definition of a minimum spanning tree. You'll need to understand the definition before the rest of these resources make sense. 
2. __Watch__ this video (6:45) on Prim's Algorithm: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyLaRffCdk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyLaRffCdk4) Afterwards, __skim__ the textbook material on Prim's algorithm and __work through__ examples 1 and 2. 
3. __Watch__ this this video (3:40) on Kruskal's Algorithm: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR6JTtAmSWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wR6JTtAmSWI) Afterwards, __skim__ the textbook material on Kruskal's Algorithm and __work through__ example 3. 
4. __Skim__ the proof of Prim's Algorithm at the end of the section and try to look for the major ideas and flow of the proof. 
5. __Read__ the blurb at the end of the section that discusses the time complexity of the two algorithms -- very important note for putting these two algorithms into practice. 

## Activities 

Activities 2 and 3 involve the following weighted graph:

1. Examine the weighted graph in Exercise 2 of Section 10.5. Find two spanning trees of this graph that have different total weights. State each spanning tree as a Python dictionary and state the total weight of each. The moral of this exercise is: _Not all spanning trees of a weighted graph necessarily weigh the same_ (so it makes sense to talk about a "minimum" spanning tree).  
2. In the weighted graph pictured above, use Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree. Describe the first _two_ steps you make in the algorithm and then state the answer (as a Python dictionary). 
3. In the weighted graph pictured above, use Kruskal's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree. Describe the first _two_ steps you make in the algorithm and then state the answer (as a Python dictionary). 
4. Generally speaking: Will Prim's Algorithm and Kruskal's Algorithm always produce the _same_ spanning tree? Or could it be the case that the two algorithms could produce different spanning trees that happen to have the same total weight? (This question will be an item of focus in our class meeting.)
