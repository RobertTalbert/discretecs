## What MTH 325 is about

MTH 325 is the sequel to MTH 225, where you learned some of the basic structures and concepts of mathematics for computer science: Logic, sets, functions, recursion and mathematical induction, and counting. In MTH 325, you'll extend these ideas to learn about four important and related ideas that are essential to computer science: 

- **Mathematical proof**: Introduced in MTH 225, [mathematical proofs](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Logic/Proof) are explanations of why a [proposition](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Logic/Propositions) about an observation is always true. In MTH 225 you learned one approach to mathematical proof, namely [mathematical induction](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Proof/Mathematical+induction). In MTH 325, we expand on induction and introduce several other forms of proof. 
- **Graphs**: A [graph](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Graphs/Graph) is an abstracted data structure used to model a network. They are of central importance to computer science, and in MTH 325 you'll learn how to apply them to real-life networks and determine information about those networks using mathematics. 
- **Trees and search**: A [tree](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Trees/Tree) is a special kind of graph that is encountered frequently in computer science, especially in different approaches to search algorithms and information systems, and like with graphs in MTH 325 you'll learn how to model real-life situations with trees. 
- **Directed graphs and relations**: A **directed graph** (or "digraph") is a graph that has a direction to it, like an airline map or a system of rivers. One special use of digraphs is to model **relations**, which are abstracted forms of relational databases. In MTH 325 you'll learn the theory behind how and why these work. 

After successful completion of MTH 325, you will be able to...

- Compute basic information about graphs, relations, and trees.
- Solve theoretical and applied problems involving applications of basic concepts of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Formulate computational problems in terms of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Construct a logical framework for a proof using mathematical induction, direct proof, proof by contraposition, or proof by contradiction.
- Analyze the structure and validity of a mathematical proof.
- Employ effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
- Explain methods and solutions of computational problems in a clear way to a specified target audience.
- Demonstrate fluency in applying algorithms in the formulation and solutions of mathematical problems.
- Assess your own work in mathematical problem solving and apply feedback to make improvements to your own work.


## What the class will be doing

**During class meetings**, active participation is essential. There will often be a brief (20 minutes or less) lecture over new concepts, followed by 20-30 minutes of activities of different types: problem solving sessions, computer-based lab work, electronic polling with discussion, and more. Your attendance and effort will be needed during every meeting of the class; without attendance and effort, it will be hard to succeed. Some class meetings are set aside for four **Exams** and makeup dates for those exams; see below for more information on that. 

**Before and after class meetings**, the main activity is **Homework**. This is a combination of practice from the topics discussed in class *and* preview activities for the next class. Those preview activities will typically involve experimenting with an idea, and perhaps learning some basic content through video or reading. You are not expected to "teach yourself the material" -- these are just activities to introduce you to a new concept. But, **the lectures in class will assume you have completed the preview activities** so a good-faith effort to complete these each time is essential for your success in the course. 

**Outside of class meetings**, other than Homework, you'll be given occasional **Advanced Homework** sets, typically every other week. These will contain more advanced problems involving applications of basic material learned in class. Since mathematical proof is a critical focus of MTH 325, you will also be completing a **Proof Portfolio** during the semester; problems involving proof will be posted and you will complete a selection of these. 

**Staying engaged** in the course both in and outside of class meetings is crucial for success. You'll occasionally be given activities that promote positive engagement with the course, for example the Startup activities at the beginning of the semester. These and other engagement-focused activities earn **Engagement Credits** (like "experience points" in a game) and you'll be accumulating engagement credits throughout the semester. 


**You can ask a question about anything at any time.** I am typically on campus MWF the entire working day with drop-in hours set aside especially for MTH 325 students from ?? to ??. Each of you is invited to drop in during those times, with any items you want to discuss, no appointment necessary. If you have a question outside those times, you can email those to me (talbertr@gvsu.edu) or set up an appointment at another time by clicking here: https://calendly.com/robert-talbert Then select "MTH 325 student appointment".


## Assignments and how these are graded 

There are three main areas that contribute to your course grade: 

- Mastery of basic skills; 
- Application of those basic skills; and 
- Engagement, effort, and participation 

**Mastery of basic skills:** The basic skills of MTH 325 can be broken down into 14 sorts of tasks, which we'll refer to as **Skills**. A list of those 14 Skills is in [Appendix A of this syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Fall2024/course-docs/MTH%20325%20Fall%202024%20syllabus.md#appendix-a-list-of-mth-325-skills). Your ability to perform these tasks is measured by completing **problems** that demonstrate those skills. A sample of these 14 kinds of problems is given in **this document**. Five (5) of these are designated as **Core** skills. Part of your course grade is determined by how well you display mastery of these 14 problems/skills. For each problem/skill, I identify three levels of performance: **Master**, **Proficient**, and **Beginner** level. These problems appear on **Exams** that occur during the semester; four of these are planned and can be found on the course calendar. Each exam is cumulative: Exam 1 will contain problems for Skills 1-4; Exam 2 will contain problems for Skills 1-8 (with the first four problems being new variants of the ones from Exam 1); Exam 3 will have Skills 1-12; and Exam 4 skills 1-14. There will also be occasional short quizzes where you can attempt 1-2 problems of your choice; and the final exam in the course consists of new variants of all 14 problems. 

I will record how well you do on each problem: "**M**" for mastery, "**P**" for proficient, and "**B**" for beginner and record the letter in Blackboard. Detailed rubrics for how those grades are determined can be found in the Standards for Student Work document. Your best attempt on a problem is kept, so if you earn an M on a problem on the first try, you do not need to reattempt it again at any point in the semester; but if you earn a P, you can try again at a subsequent exam or quiz, or on the final. 

**Application of basic skills:** The basic skills can be applied in two different ways: *real world applications* and *mathematical proofs*. 

Real-world applications appear on **Advanced Homework** sets which you'll receive roughly every other week. These include some basic and extended practice problems, and harder problems that involve applications. Each Advanced Homework is graded as a whole using a rubric found in the Standards for Student Work document, and in Blackboard we record either **Success** if the work meets the standards, or **Retry** if it does not. 

We will maintain a running list of **proof problems**, added to on a regular basis as we learn more material, from which you can select a few to demonstrate skill with writing proofs. You'll take the ones you select, solve them, give them a nice writeup, and submit them on Blackboard for grading. Like Advanced Homework, proof problems are graded using a rubric found in the Standards for Student Work document, and in Blackboard we record either **Success** if the work meets the standards, or **Retry** if it does not. 

The process of revising or resubmitting Advanced Homework or proof problems is given in detail below, in "How to revise or reattempt an assignment". 

**Engagement, effort, and participation:** There are several ways to demonstrate engagement with the class. 

- The foremost is **Homework**, which as described above is a brief assignment given after a class meeting that contains a review of the lesson and a preview of the next lesson. *Completing Homework regularly is critically important for success in MTH 325*. Homework is graded either **Success** or **Incomplete** on the basis of completeness, effort, and timeliness. See the Standards for Student Work document for details. 
- Other activities will appear in the class that will let you earn **engagement credits**. Attending a class meeting earns one engagement credit. Other activities will have different engagement credit values. By completing these activities, you'll accumulate engagement credits through the semester. 


## How course grades are determined 

Your basic course grade -- A, B, C, D, or F without plus/minus modifiers -- is earned by completing a minimum number of requirements in each of the main types of assignments in the class, using the table below. The numbers in the "Skills" column refer to the number of **Master** ratings you earn; **Skilled** and **Beginner** do not count in this total. The numbers in Advanced Homework,  Proof problems, and Homework refer to the number of **Success** marks earned. We are initially planning on a total of 8 Advanced Homework sets, between 8 and 12 Proof problems, 20 regular Homeworks, and a total of 70 engagement credits; if these numbers should change during the semester, the table will be updated accordingly. 

| Grade | Skills | Advanced Homework | Proof problems | Homework | Engagement Credits | 
| :---: | :----: | :---------------: | :------------: | :------: | :----------------: | 
| A | 13 | 6 | 6 | 18 | 60 | 
| B | 10 | 4 | 3 | 16 | 50 | 
| C | 7 | 2 | N/A | 14 | 40 |
| D | 5 | N/A | N/A | 10 | 20 | 

Your course grade is the *highest* grade for which *all* the requirements in its row are met. A grade of "F" is given if not all of the requirements for a "D" are met. 

**Mastering the core:** Failing to earn Master rating on all five Core skills will result in a one-letter grade penalty (for example B- to C-). 


**Final exam and plus/minus modifiers:** The final exam in the course will be one more exam where all 14 skills are present (that is, a duplicate of Exam 4 with new variants of each problem). A "plus" is added to your basic grade by taking the final exam and doing Master-level work on all 5 Core skills plus any 2 others. A "minus" grade is given if either you don't take the final exam, or you take it but fail to do "Master" level work on all 5 Core skills. (So, the final exam's impact on the course grade is only to determine plus/minus modifiers.)


**Borderline cases:** Borderline cases in the grade table (for example, completing all requirements for a grade except for one) will be decided using Homework completion and engagement credits. So it's to your advantage to complete all Homeworks and earn as many engagement credits as you can. You may be assigned a course grade higher than what the syllabus indicates if I believe it's warranted by your Homework and engagement; you will never be assigned a course grade lower than what the syllabus indicates.

What this way of determining grades says, in regular language, is that: 
- If you master half the skills in the class including the five Core skills, provide minimal but nonzero evidence of being able to apply those to real world problems, and stay reasonably engaged in the class, you can expect a grade of "C". 
- Earning an "A" on the other hand means you have mastered all, or all but one, of the skills in the course including the five Core skills, provided consistent evidence that you can apply those basics, written several good mathematical proofs, and have stayed consistently engaged and prepared for class. 

This way of doing grades is unusual, but it has some advantages: 

- Almost every assignment can be revised or reattempted if you need to improve your work (see the next section below), and once you have demonstrated Mastery on a problem, homework, or proof you do not have to revisit it again in the course (except skills, at the final exam). It's possible that if you do well on the Exams, you will only need to work a fraction of the final exam. Many times, students just opt out of the final altogether if they have strong Exam performances (and don't care about having a minus). 
- If you have a shaky performance on an assignment early in the semester, you have time to practice and improve, and those early performances don't hurt you. 
- Because your grade is earned by accumulating successes, your grade in the course never goes down -- it only stays the same or goes up. 
- It is easy to track your grade and find where you stand since there's no math involved other than adding up successes. 

The main downside of this way of doing grades is that it can be complicated, and it can seem weird at first. We will take time to practice with the system; most students "get it" after a couple of weeks of use. But, if at any time you are uncertain about how you are doing in the class, please ask me and I'll be happy to clarify your situation.

## How to revise or reattempt an assignment

**Almost every assignment in the class can be revised or reattempted if you are not happy with the results, and you are not penalized for any reattempt or revision.** The exception to this rule is Homework and items earning engagement credits; there are no reattempts or revisions allowed on Homework since it is partially a preview of an upcoming class, and since it's graded only on completeness, effort, and timeliness it is very easy to get a **Success** mark every time. Likewise, engagement credit items are typically one-off items that you either complete or don't complete, so revision doesn't apply. 

For the other assignments in the class, here are the details for how this works: 

- **Skills/Exam problems**: Exams are cumulative, so each exam contains new skills/problems as well as new variants of older ones. If you attempt a skill/problem and do not earn **Master** on it, you can reattempt it at the next exam or at a quiz given in between exams. 
- **Advanced Homework**: You can revise and resubmit each Advanced Homework set **once** (for a total of two attempts). Your initial attempt will get verbal feedback on it, and you can use the feedback to make any corrections or improvements that are called for. Advanced Homework is submitted on Blackboard in an assignment area; revisions are simply submitted to the same assignment area. 
- **Proof problems**: You can revise and resubmit attempts at proof problems **as many times as needed but no more than three total submissions per week** including initial submissions. So for example, in a given week you can submit two new proofs and a revision of a previous one; or three revisions; or three new proofs; and so on. Like Advanced Homework, revisions of proofs are uploaded to Blackboard in the same assignment area as the original submission. 

For the purposes of revision, a "week" is defined to run from Sunday through Saturday, like on a calendar. 

To keep the grading process operating efficiently we will place the following restrictions on revision and reattempts: 

- As mentioned above, Advanced Homework sets can be revised only once; proof problems can be revised as needed but there is a limit of three total submissions per week. 
- Advanced Homework and some proof problems will come with a deadline for initial submissions. **You must submit a complete, good-faith effort on the assignment prior to the deadline in order to be eligible to revise or resubmit it**. Examples of situations where revision would *not* be allowed include the following: 
  - The assignment is not submitted at all before the deadline (In other words you cannot "revise" an assignment you did not turn in)
  - The assignment is submitted but some problems are skipped or omitted either partially or entirely, or includes responses saying something like "I didn't know how to do this part" 
  - The assignment is submitted but the work has significant issues or errors throughout -- so much so that it is impossible to tell if there is any understanding of the concepts.  
- No revisions or reattempts on any item are allowed after **11:59pm ET on Sunday, December 8**. This is the beginning of the last week of classes, and no revisions or reattempts are allowed after that point so that the queue of items to grade can be cleared prior to the final exam. 



## How we will use technology

## Academic integrity policy

## Other class policies 

**Instructor availability:** Email (talbertr@gvsu.edu) is the best way to reach me with a message outside of class meetings. **All messages needing a response will receive one within one (1) working day** (that is, Monday through Friday). I typically check email **twice during the working day** (early morning and late afternoon) and **do not check email after 5:00pm, before 7:00am, or at any time on weekends**. If you send a message during those times and your message needs a response, you will get one promptly when I am back at work. But in particular, please note that **messages in the evenings and on weekends will not typically get an immediate response**.
