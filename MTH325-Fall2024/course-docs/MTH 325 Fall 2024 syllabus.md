## About this Syllabus

**Welcome to MTH 325!** I'm Dr. Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm grateful you're here. 

**This syllabus contains all the information you need to navigate the course.** The main document will be kept continuously up to date at this link. When you see blue- or purple-underlined text in the syllabus or any other document, it's a clickable link. For example, [click here for a cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuUidBR1aQ). A PDF version of the syllabus is available upon request. 

**This document is meant to be read once, then searched as needed.** If you need to find something, the easiest way is to pull up this  document, hit `Control-F` (Windows) or `Command-F` (Mac), and then do a search for the text you're looking for. 

All course materials for MTH 325 are available on GitHub at https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs. The current version is in the folder `MTH325-Fall2024`. Critically important documents will also be on Blackboard in the *Course Documents* folder. 

This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

**Instructor:** Robert Talbert, Ph.D., Professor of Mathematics. Office: MAK C2513. Email: talbertr@gvsu.edu. Phone: (616)331-8968. **Be sure to read [my availability policy](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Fall2024/course-docs/MTH%20325%20Fall%202024%20syllabus.md#other-class-policies) below.**

**Drop-in hours:** TBD

**Webpage:** The course Blackboard site is at http://lms.gvsu.edu. A Course Page, containing a summary of links to important documents and a record of class activities, is [at this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HAZgvPWV7PeU774Ou-lfoNLWRDSsH9HBjf0ftqW1lus/edit?usp=sharing). 

**Resources:** The **Course Vault** is a wiki containing articles for each of the major concepts of MTH 325 (and MTH 225) and will serve as our primary "textbook": https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs Other resources, such as video content and instructional websites, will be provided as needed. There is no required textbook, but the online text [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) is available for free as an optional supplement. 

**Technology requirements:** It's highly recommended to have a laptop and access to a high-speed internet connection for work outside of class. You will need access to a basic handheld calculator for Checkpoint assessments in class. There is no preferred model of device. For in-class technology use, please see the policies in the "How we will use technology" section below. 

## What MTH 325 is about

MTH 325 is the sequel to MTH 225, where you learned some of the basic structures and concepts of mathematics for computer science: Logic, sets, functions, recursion and mathematical induction, and counting. In MTH 325, you'll extend these ideas to learn about four important and related ideas that are essential to computer science: 

- **Mathematical proof**: Introduced in MTH 225, [mathematical proofs](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Logic/Proof) are explanations of why a [proposition](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Logic/Propositions) about an observation is always true. In MTH 225 you learned one approach to mathematical proof, namely [mathematical induction](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Proof/Mathematical+induction). In MTH 325, we expand on induction and introduce several other forms of proof. 
- **Graphs**: A [graph](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Graphs/Graph) is an abstracted data structure used to model a network. They are of central importance to computer science, and in MTH 325 you'll learn how to apply them to real-life networks and determine information about those networks using mathematics. 
- **Trees and search**: A [tree](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Trees/Tree) is a special kind of graph that is encountered frequently in computer science, especially in different approaches to search algorithms and information systems, and like with graphs in MTH 325 you'll learn how to model real-life situations with trees. 
- **Directed graphs and relations**: A **directed graph** (or "digraph") is a graph that has a direction to it, like an airline map or a system of rivers. One special use of digraphs is to model **relations**, which are abstracted forms of relational databases. In MTH 325 you'll learn the theory behind how and why these work. 

After successful completion of MTH 325, you will be able to...

- Compute basic information about graphs, relations, and trees.
- Solve theoretical and applied problems involving applications of basic concepts of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Formulate computational problems in terms of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Construct a logical framework for a proof using mathematical induction, direct proof, proof by contraposition, or proof by contradiction.
- Analyze the structure and validity of a mathematical proof.
- Employ effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
- Explain methods and solutions of computational problems in a clear way to a specified target audience.
- Demonstrate fluency in applying algorithms in the formulation and solutions of mathematical problems.
- Assess one's own work in mathematical problem solving and apply feedback to make improvements to one's own work.

**Instructor availability:** Email (talbertr@gvsu.edu) is the best way to reach me with a message outside of class meetings. **All messages needing a response will receive one within one (1) working day** (that is, Monday through Friday). I typically check email **twice during the working day** (early morning and late afternoon) and **do not check email after 5:00pm, before 7:00am, or at any time on weekends**. If you send a message during those times and your message needs a response, you will get one promptly when I am back at work. But in particular, please note that **messages in the evenings and on weekends will not typically get an immediate response**.
