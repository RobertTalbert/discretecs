**Resources:** The **Class Vault** is a wiki containing articles for each of the major concepts of MTH 325 (and MTH 225) and will serve as our primary "textbook": https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs Other resources, such as video content and instructional websites, will be provided as needed. There is no required textbook, but the online text [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3.html) is available for free as an optional supplement. 

**Technology requirements:** It's highly recommended to have a laptop and access to a high-speed internet connection for work outside of class. You will need access to a basic handheld calculator for Checkpoint assessments in class. There is no preferred model of device.
