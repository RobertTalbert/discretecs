# Standards for Student Work -- MTH 325 Fall 2024

## How to use this document

**This document contains all the details of what you will be asked to do on different assessments in the course, and what constitutes "successful" work on each task.** You should consider this document to be of equal importance as the Syllabus and calendar in terms of guiding your progress in the course. Study it carefully and refer to it each time before submitting an assignment, to ensure you're giving your best effort and to minimize the number of revisions and resubmissions you will do.

## Ground Rules for all student work 

Unless otherwise stated, every assignment in MTH 325 operates under the following guidelines: 

- **It is not enough just to give a correct answer to a problem**: You must also give a clear, correct, and complete explanation. (There are some exceptions, for example Homework items rarely request explanations.)
- **The target audience for your explanations is your classmates**. Your explanation should allow a person who has the same level of training and background as you -- but who has no familiarity with the problem you are solving -- to follow your solution from beginning to end and agree with your answer, without having to do much or any extra work. If your explanation skips steps; or simply asserts that something is true rather than explains why; or uses language that is unclear or hard to follow; or is disorganized or illogical; or other such things, you'll probably be asked to revise and resubmit. 
- **Solutions to problems should generally be free of any significant errors, and you should try to submit work that is totally free of these.** The [Appendix](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Fall2024/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20W24.md#appendix-what-is-an-error) to this document goes into detail about what is considered an "error". 
- **On the other hand, minor errors are typically ignored as long as there are not too many of them.** An error is "minor" if it is not central to the concept being assessed. Rather than hashing out partial credit, we'll just ignore mistakes that are small and don't pertain to the main concept. For example, if a problem involves computing the [binomial coefficient](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Combinatorics/Binomial+coefficient) $\binom{5}{2}$, and you use the formula correctly to reduce this to $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3$ but then compute $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 20$, as long as the rest of the solution is consistent with that mistake, your solution might still be OK. But please note, an error that is insignificant in one problem might be central in another! 

## Standards for Engagement Credit items

Items that earn Engagement Credit are typically small, one-time assignments, including but not limited to: 

- The Startup activities (Syllabus quiz, Math diagnostic quiz, personal survey, PDF upload practice)
- Occasional online practice sets (separate from homework)
- Feedback surveys given every 3-5 weeks 

Each of these items will have "Success Criteria" clearly indicated on the assignment. Often, the success criteria consist simply of completing the activity before a deadline. **Satisfying the success criteria earns all the engagement credits; failing to satisfy the success criteria earns no engagement credits.** 


## Standards for Homework 

Homework is graded either **Success** or **Incomplete**: 

| Grade | Criteria | 
| :----: | :----: | 
| **Success** | The homework set is turned in prior to its deadline; all items not labelled "Optional" have a response that represents a good faith effort at a substantive answer. | 
| **Incomplete** | The homework set is not turned in on time; or there is at least one non-Optional item that is either missing or has a response indicating insufficient effort. | 

Notes: 

- Mathematical correctness is not part of the grading criteria for Homework -- only completeness, effort, and timeliness. 
- *All* items not marked optional must have a good-faith effort at a correct response. Leaving an item blank, even if accidentally, results in an **Incomplete** grade. Giving a response like "I don't know" or "I don't understand" also earns an **Incomplete** grade; if you don't know or understand how to respond to a question, you are expected to ask someone for help. 

## Standards for Skills/Exam Problems

Each of the 14 Skills in the course are assessed through exam problems. See the [Sample Final Exam](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Fall2024/course-docs/Sample%20Final%20Exam%20W24.md) for examples of what these look like. Skills/Problems are graded on three levels: **Master**, **Proficient**, or **Beginner**. Your best attempt is always the one recorded in Blackboard. The grades are based on **completeness, clarity, and correctness**: 

| Grade | Criteria | 
| :----: | :----: | 
| **Master** | Each part of the problem has a response that is free from significant errors, has correct answers, and each answer is supported by a clear explanation either in English or in mathematical steps that are clearly shown.  | 
| **Proficient** | Partial evidence of understanding of the concepts is shown from the work. But, there is one or more significant error, or an answer that appears with insufficient explanation. | 
| **Beginner** | The problem has been attempted, but the work contains repeated significant errors or repeated answers without sufficient explanation. | 

Notes: 

- Again: **It is not enough just to get right answers: You must also provide a clear explanation for your answers**. Your goal on a Skill/Problem is to provide indisputable evidence that you have mastered the concept in the problem. It is not to your advantage to withhold any such evidence. So provide clear mathematical steps *and* a brief but clear English explanation in order to give sufficient evidence to warrant a **Master** grade. 


## Standards for Advanced Homework 

Advanced Homework sets contain optional practice exercises along with required problems that typically aim toward applications of basic skills. Optional practice exercises are clearly labeled and are not graded, but if you turn them in you can get feedback on your work. The required problems, also clearly labeled, are graded as a whole, either **Success** or **Retry**: 

| Grade | Criteria | 
| :----: | :----: | 
| **Success** | As a whole, the problem solutions are mostly free of significant errors and include clear, correct, and complete explanations that explain to the reader why the answer is correct. | 
| **Retry** | As a whole, the problem solutions show a good-faith effort to complete each problem correctly. But, there are repeated significant errors, or at least one error that is very significant, (and you'd benefit from redoing the problem), or one or more of the explanations is insufficient or needs revision.  | 

As stated in [the Syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Fall2024/course-docs/MTH%20325%20Fall%202024%20syllabus.md), *every* required problem on Advanced Homework sets must have a good-faith effort at a complete, clear, and correct solution. Leaving a problem blank, or skipping one or more parts of a problem, or giving a solution with little to no explanation, or giving a partial solution (it's correct up to a point and then says something like "I didn't know where to go from here") will not be graded --- it will not get a **Retry** because a revision will not be allowed. 



 
## Standards for Proof problems 

Proof problems are also graded either **Success** or **Retry** on the basis of completeness, correctness, and clarity. Proof problems are particularly focused on **clarity**, that is, whether your argument is easy to follow by target audience (your classmates). 

| Grade | Criteria | 
| :----: | :----: | 
| **Success** | As a whole, the proof is free of significant error, and a person on the level of a MTH 325 student can easily follow the steps of the argument from beginning to end, agree with the conclusions, and not have to do much extra work to fill in steps. | 
| **Retry** | As a whole, the proof show a good-faith effort at a complete, clear, and correct argument. But, there are significant errors; or there are gaps, or points of unclarity in the argument (the reader would not be able to follow the argument from beginning to end and agree with the conclusion without doing significant extra work).  | 

Please note, **a well written proof is not just a collection of mathematical computations**. It is a narrative explanation that contains math when necessary, but is largely driven by verbal explanation. If your proof is mostly or entirely just lines of math, it likely needs to be fleshed out with English explanations. If your proof is nothing but English and there's no math, it likely lacks precision and needs computation. 


## Appendix: What is an "error"? 

There are four main kinds of major errors that can affect a solution to a problem: 

1. *Computational error*. This is when you simply make a mistake in computing something, like adding $5+3$ and getting $9$. (Sometimes these computational errors are not "major"; but always strive to find and fix them before submitting work.)
2. *Logical error*. This is when you draw incorrect conclusions from data. For example, if you are told that the statement "All math professors are over 40 years old" is false but conclude that *no* math professors are over 40, that's a logical error. (You can only conclude that *there exists* a math professor who isn't over 40.)
3. *Factual error*. This results from misstating definitions, theorems, steps of an algorithm, or parameters in a problem statement. For example, if you are using the Binomial Coefficient and get the formula wrong, that's a significant factual error (even if you use the wrong formula correctly). Or, if a problem states that there are 100 objects that need to be sorted but you mis-copy and write down 10 objects, that's a factual error. **Many errors in MTH 325 result from incorrectly reading or copying down information. These errors are easy to avoid, simply by slowing down and double-checking your steps.**
4. *Semantic error*. This happens when you make a statement that is grammatically correct, but the statement itself has no meaning. For example the statement "*MTH 325 is a very purple unicorn*" obeys the rules of the English language, but it makes no sense. The same is true of the statement, "*The function of the set is 3*" (there is no such thing as "the function of the set") or "*The graph G is [isomorphic](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Graphs/Isomorphism) but the graph H is not*" (the term "isomorphic" always refers to two graphs, and it cannot be used to describe a single graph). Semantic errors can be hard for those learning the subject to catch before making them. They will be politely pointed out in your feedback to help you spot and correct them. 


I will refer to these kinds of errors by name in your feedback. Everyone will make at least one of these at some point, and you'll be able to revise when you make them; just be aware that these errors exist and what we mean by the names.
