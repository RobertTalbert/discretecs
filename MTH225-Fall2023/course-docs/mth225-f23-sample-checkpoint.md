# MTH 225 Sample Checkpoints

## Overview

**Checkpoints** are timed quizzes that ask you to demonstrate your skill on the Learning Targets of MTH 225. Each Checkpoint contains several problems, with each problem focusing on a single Learning Target. **CORE** Learning Targets appear on every Checkpoint following their first appearance. Non-**CORE** targets appear on *three* consecutive Checkpoints and then are "retired" until the end of the semester, where there are Checkpoints featuring all 15 Learning Targets. 

To give you a sense of what the Checkpoints look like, below are sample Checkpoints for Checkpoints 1, 2, and 4 with some notes about each. The syllabus gives a complete schedule of which Learning Targets are covered on which Checkpoints and when these are given.

## Sample Checkpoint 1

>[!NOTE]
>The first Checkpoint contains problems for Learning Targets 1 and 2 only. All Checkpoint problems include a statement of the Learning Target being addressed, the problem itself, and "success criteria" telling you what exactly constitutes a successful demonstration of skill. 

### Learning Target 1

> I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16 including negative integers in base 2. 

Do **all** of the following: 

1. Convert the base 10 integer $334$ to binary. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
2. Convert the base 8 integer $725$ to decimal. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
3. Convert the base 2 integer `10110011` to hexadecimal. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
4. The 8-bit binary representation of the decimal number $77$ is `01001101`. Write the 8-bit binary representation of $-77$ using two's complement notation. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. Up to two simple errors are allowed. 


### Learning Target 2 

> (**CORE**) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers in base 2.

## Sample Checkpoint 2

>[!NOTE]
>Checkpoint 2 contains new versions of problems for Learning Targets 1 and 2, and introduces Learning Targets 3 and 4. In practice, you would not necessarily need to attempt the problems for Learning Targets 1 or 2 again; only if you needed to (for example you want to earn Level 2 on Learning Target 1 by completing two successful attempts) and felt ready to. Learning Target 2 will appear on *all* future Checkpoints because it's a CORE Learning Target. Learning Target 1 will rotate off of Checkpoints following Checkpoint 3. 

### Learning Target 1

2. Convert the base 16 integer $55FA$ to decimal. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
3. Convert the base 2 integer `10011000` to octal. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
4. The 8-bit binary representation of the decimal number $121$ is `01111001`. Write the 8-bit binary representation of $-121$ using two's complement notation. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. Up to two simple errors are allowed. 


### Learning Target 2 

>(**CORE**) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers in base 2. 


Do **all** of the following:

2. Subtract the base-2 integers `11001011` and `10010110`. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
3. Multiply the base-2 integers `10101` and `11`. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 
4. Divide the base-2 integer `11000110` by `10`. *Show your work and circle your answer*. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. Up to two simple errors are allowed. 

### Learning Target 3

>(**CORE**) I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation.


Consider the conditional statement: *If $n$ is even, then its binary representation ends in a 0.* 

1. State the **hypothesis** of this statement. 
2. State the **conclusion** of this statement. 
3. State the **converse** of this statement. 
4. State the **contrapositive** of this statement.
5. State the **inverse** of this statement.
6. State the **negation** of this statement (without simply putting "Not" or "It is not the case that" in the front of the statement). 

**Success criteria:** All answers are given in clear and correct English (*not* in symbolic notation). The negation and contrapositive must be correct, and no more than one error is allowed in the others. 


### Learning Target 4

>I can construct truth tables for propositions involving two or three atomic propositions and use truth tables to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent.


Construct a correct truth table for each of the following statements.  

1. $\neg (p \wedge q)$
2. $p \rightarrow (q \vee r)$

**Success criteria:** Both truth tables have the correct number of rows with no duplicated rows. All intermediate columns are shown. No more than three total errors are permitted. (If you make a mistake in an intermediate column but the rest of the row is correct given that mistake, then the mistake only counts once.)

## Sample Checkpoint 4

>[!NOTE]
>By Checkpoint 4, Learning Target 1 has been "retired" after three consecutive appearances; it will appear again on Checkpoints 11 and 13 and at the final exam. Checkpoint 4 will be the third appearance of Learning Targets 2--4, the second appearance of Learning Target 5, and the first appearance of Learning Targets 6-7. 

## Learning Target 2

>I can determine the truth value of a predicate at a specific input, the truth value of a quantified predicate, and the negation of a quantified predicate.

Consider the predicates: 

- $P(x):  x \, \text{is even}$
- $Q(x):  x+2 \, \text{is an integer}$

The domain of each predicate is the set of all integers (positive, negative, and zero).

1. For each of the following, state whether the expression is **True**, **False**, or **Undetermined**.  
    (a) $P(2)$
    (b) $Q(9)$
    (c) $\forall x Q(x)$ 
    (d) $\exists y (\neg P(y))$ 
2. State the negation of the statement, "Every problem for this Learning Target has the same answer" without merely putting the word "not", "It is not the case that", etc. on the statement. 


**Success criteria:** All the answers in the first item are correct, and the second item is correct. 

## Learning Target 6

>(CORE) I can determine elements of a recursively-defined sequence using a recurrence relation and derive a recurrence relation for a recursively-defined sequence.

1. List the first six (6) terms of each of the following sequences. You do not need to show your work, but your answers must be correct. 

    (a) $c_0 = 2, \ \text{and} \ c_n = 5c_{n-1} + n \ \text{if} \ n > 0$
    (b) $d_0 = 1, d_1 = 2 \ \text{and} \ d_n = d_{n-1} - 2d_{n-2} \ \text{if} \ n > 1$

2. Give a correct recurrence relation for the sequence $2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26, \dots$. Explain your reasoning. 

**Success criteria:** Both sequences have at least 5 correct entries, and the recurrence relation in part 2 is correct and explained. 

## Learning Target 7

>(CORE) Given a statement to prove using mathematical induction, I can state the framework of a proof. (Identify the predicate, identify and prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and state what needs to be proven in the inductive step)

Consider the statement: For all natural numbers $n$, a set with $n$ elements has $2^n$ subsets. 

1. Identify the predicate in this statement and state it clearly. 
2. State the base case and explain why it is true. 
3. State the inductive hypothesis. 
4. Explain clearly what needs to be proven in the inductive step. 
 
 
**Success criteria:** All four parts are correct and clearly stated.
