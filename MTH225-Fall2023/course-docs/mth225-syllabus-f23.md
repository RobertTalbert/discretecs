# MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1

![](mth225-banner.jpg)

>Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do.

## About MTH 225 and this syllabus

**Welcome to MTH 225!** I'm Dr. Robert Talbert, the professor of this course. I'm grateful you're here. 

In this course, you will learn **the math that all of computer science is based on**. You'll learn things like how to do arithmetic in binary, how to count the number of ways to deal a five-card poker hand, and how to generate complex data structures using simple rules involving recursion. And more! By studying discrete structures, **you'll gain a superpower to make you an expert learner** of any hardware and any software, including those that haven't been invented yet. As a computer scientist, your ability to learn new things quickly, and use fundamental concepts to model complex ideas, are more valuable than your coding skills. 

**This syllabus contains all the information you need to navigate the course.** The main document will be kept continuously up to date at this link. When you see blue- or purple-underlined text in the syllabus or any other document, it's a clickable link. For example, [click here for a cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuUidBR1aQ). A PDF version of the syllabus will also be available on Blackboard in the *Syllabus and Calendar* area, but it will not be updated unless there is a major change. 

**This document is meant to be read once, then searched as needed.** If you need to find something, the easiest way is to pull up this  document, hit `Control-F` and then do a search for the text you're looking for. 

All course materials for MTH 225 are available on GitHub at https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs. Critically important documents (syllabus, etc.) will also be on Blackboard. 

## Key Information

**Meetings:** Section 03 and Section 04 meet Monday/Wednesday/Friday in Mackinac Hall B-1-110. Section 03 meets 12:00-12:50pm and Section 04 meets 2:00-2:50pm. 

**Student drop-in hours:** TBD

**Blackboard, Class Page, and Class Vault:** Our main course portal is on Blackboard, which you can access at http://lms.gvsu.edu. Please note that we are using *Blackboard Ultra*, a major update to Blackboard which has significant differences from previous versions. If you need a tutorial on how to navigate Blackboard Ultra, **LINK NEEDED**. We use two other electronic resources for the class: the **Class Page** (click here to access **LINK NEEDED**) which is a Google Doc showing notes and resources for class meetings; and the **Class Vault** ([click here to access](https://publish.obsidian.md/mth225) which serves as our primary textbook. All of these are linked together, so you don't need to remember them all. 

**Contacting the prof:** Email (talbertr@gvsu.edu) is preferred. You can schedule a video or phone call outside of office hours through [my Calendly page](https://calendly.com/robert-talbert/). Be sure to read my availability/response policy **LINK NEEDED**

**Course calendar:** The official course calendar is in Google Calendar. **LINK NEEDED**. linked on the [Class Page](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/HyTuIxi4q) and on Blackboard. *In case of a date conflict on assignments or course documents, the Class Calendar is assumed to be correct.* 

**Definition of "week":** In our course, a "week" is defined to begin at 12:01am ET on Monday and end at 11:59pm ET the following Sunday. 

**Course content and videos:** There is no formal textbook for this course. The content for the course is at the Class Vault (https://publish.obsidian.md/mth225). A *optional* additional textbook is [Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/dmoi.html) by Oscar Levin. It's free; just click the link. A PDF copy is available for download [here](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/pdfs/dmoi3-tablet.pdf). Not all course material is included in this textbook, and we may not follow the exact sequence that this book uses. But you are free to use it as a supplement. A playlist of instructional videos is available on Vimeo at https://vimeo.com/showcase/8667148, and individual videos are embedded in the class vault. 

**Course tools:** We will use [Miro](http://miro.com) (an online whiteboard tool) for class work and other purposes. You will also be using Juypyter notebooks on the [Google Colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com/) throughout the course. You'll receive some training on these tools in the first week of classes. 

**Technology:** For our class, you should have access to a laptop (a tablet is acceptable but not recommended) and a high-speed internet connection. You are *strongly encouraged* to have a device with a touchscreen and stylus input, or an external drawing pad, for handwritten work at an online whiteboard. If technology access is an issue for you, please let me know so we can discuss your options. 

## How to have an good experience in MTH 225

**I want you to be successful in this class.** This is my #1 priority as a professor at GVSU. Everything in MTH 225 is built to lead you toward having a deep learning experience that is also deeply enjoyable. My goal is to challenge you and support you in equal measures, so you'll learn a lot and have a great experience in the process. 

In MTH 225, you can expect:

- A learning environment that challenges you, but also where support is readily available and freely given. 
- Work that is meaningful and not "busy work", and grading practices that prioritize growth and improvement. 
- Transparency and openness in how the course is run, including clear instructions on what you need to do and when, prompt and helpful feedback on your work, and timely replies to messages and questions. 
- Openness to your ideas about the course, with regular solicitations for feedback that are taken seriously through a continuous improvement process. 
- Above all, **respect** -- for you as a learner, as an adult, and as a human. 

Success in MTH 225 is within everyone's reach, but it's not effortless. On your end, your success in the course depends on three things: 

1. **Active engagement during class time**. The best  way to learn anything is to be an active participant in the process. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn. Make it a priority not to just attend and take notes, but *get involved*. 
2. **Asking questions**. The material in MTH 225 is challenging, and you will almost certainly be lost, confused, and/or stuck at times. **This is not a defect -- it's normal and it means you're doing the course right.** When struggle happens, don't wait for things to make sense on their own: *Ask questions* of me and your classmates and take action to make sense of the material. 
3. **Good management of time, tasks, and information.** Understanding the material won't help you if you procrastinate, skip announcements, or don't use a calendar. All course information will be clearly laid out for you, but it's up to you to import that information into your own lives and act on it. 

If you can commit to these three things, then I have every expectation that you'll succeed in the course, no matter what your math background or perceived math skill is.
