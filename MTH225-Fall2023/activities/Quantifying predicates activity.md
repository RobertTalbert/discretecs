# Quick Activity: Quantifying predicates

## MTH 225, 2023-09-20

Below are several predicates, and next to each one is a box for the *existentially quantified* predicate and a box for the *universally quantified* predicate. 

If you believe the existentially or universally quantified predicate is a *proposition*, then determine whether it's **TRUE** or **FALSE** and put your result in the appropriate box. 

If you believe the existentially or universally quantified predicate is a *predicate* whose truth value depends on the value of an input, write **PREDICATE** in the box.  

The domain of each predicate below is the set of all non-negative integers: $\{ 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \}$. (We will soon refer to this set as the set of all **natural numbers**.) 



| Predicate $P(n)$                                             | Existentially quantified $\exists n P(n)$ | Universally quantified $\forall n P(n)$ |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| The number $n$ is less than $5$.                             |                                           |                                         |
| The number $n$ is between $0$ and $1$ (but not equal to $0$ or $1$). |                                           |                                         |
| The number $n$ , when divided by 2, has a remainder of either 0 or 1. |                                           |                                         |

**Bonus question**: Can you come up with a predicate $Q(n)$ whose domain is the natural numbers (like above), where $\exists n Q(n)$ is **FALSE** but $\forall n Q(n)$ is **TRUE**? If so, write that predicate out. If not, be ready to explain why not.
