# Truth tables and logical equivalence 

## MTH 225, 2023-09-15



### Warm-up 

**Write a truth table for $\neg (P \rightarrow Q)$.** Questions to ask first: How many rows will it have? What should the columns be? What goes in each row/column and how do you tell? 





### Basic practice and application to logical equivalence

First: recall that the truth table for $P \rightarrow Q$ is 

| $P$  | $Q$  | $P \rightarrow Q$ |
| :--: | :--: | :---------------: |
|  T   |  T   |         T         |
|  T   |  F   |         F         |
|  F   |  T   |         T         |
|  F   |  F   |         F         |



1. Write a truth table for $(\neg P) \vee Q$.  (How many rows? What are the columns? How do you fill them in?) 

2. Write a truth table for $P \wedge (\neg Q)$. (How many rows? What are the columns? How do you fill them in?)

3. Write a truth table for $(\neg P) \rightarrow (\neg Q)$. 

4. To which of the three propositions above is $P \rightarrow Q$ logically equivalent? (*What does that term mean? How do you know when two propositions are logically equivalent?*)

5. Which of the statements in questions 1-3 is logically equivalent to $\neg (P \rightarrow Q)$?
