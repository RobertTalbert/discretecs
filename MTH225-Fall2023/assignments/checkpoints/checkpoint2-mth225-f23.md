# MTH 225: Checkpoint 2

This quiz contains four problems: Two new instances of **Learning Targets 1 and 2**, and the first appearance of **Learning Targets 3 and 4**.  Each problem is an opportunity to give a *successful demonstration of skill* on the Learning Target as described in the syllabus. A successful demonstration of skill on a Learning Target here will move you to "Level 1" on that target. 

**Instructions**: 

* You do not need to work both problems if you do not feel ready to do so. Checkpoint 2 next week will provide another attempt on each. 
* **A basic scientific or graphing calculator is the only technology allowed**. If you are using a smartphone app as your calculator, your phone *must* be switched to airplane mode. The use of any other technology, or phone apps with internet enabled, will be treated as academic dishonesty. 
* **You are not allowed any notes** on Checkpoints. 
* **Do all work on separate pages.** Note that space is *not* provided below for your work. 
* **Put each Learning Target on its own page.** Please *do not* put both Learning Targets on the same page as this will interfere with the grading and return process. If you need two sides of a page for a single target, that's fine; but do not put two Learning Targets on the same piece of paper. 
* Make sure to **put your name on each page you are handing in.**
* Note that each problem has *Success Criteria* listed. These are the standards for what constitutes a "successful" demonstration of skill. Make sure to read through those criteria and double check your work against them before turning in your work.

## Learning Target 1

> I can convert a positive integer from base 10 to base 2, 8, and 16 and vice versa and represent a negative integer in base 2 using two's complement notation. 

Be sure to *show your work* and please *put a circle or box around each answer*. 

1. Convert the base 10 integer $888$ to octal (base 8) using the base conversion algorithm. (On this part, you *must* use the base conversion algorithm and no other method.)
2. Convert the base 16 integer $3A2$ to base 10.  
3. Convert the base 2 integer `111 0010` to base 8. 
4. The 8-bit binary representation of the base 10 integer $22$ is `0001 0110`. Write the 8-bit binary representation of $-22$ using two's complement. 

**Success criteria:** Three of the four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. Up to two "simple errors" (as described in the *Standards for Student Work* document) are allowed. The first part must use the base conversion algorithm we learned in class. 



## Learning Target 2

> (**CORE**) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide positive integers in base 2. 



1. Add the base-2 integers `11001101` and `00010110`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
2. Subtract the base-2 integers `1100110 and ` `000101`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
3. Multiply the base-2 integers `10111` and `101`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
4. Divide the base-2 integer `10011` by `11`. **Show your work and circle your answers**. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. **All arithmetic must be done entirely in base 2 without converting to base 10 first.** Up to two "simple errors" (as described in the *Standards for Student Work* document) are allowed. 



## :new: Learning Target 3

> (**CORE**) I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation.

Consider the statement: *If it is raining, we will not play.* State, in clear English: 

1. The hypothesis of the statement
2. The conclusion of the statement
3. The converse of the statement
4. The contrapositive of the statement
5. The inverse of the statement
6. The negation of the statement (Do not just put "not" or "it is not the case that" in front of the statement)

**Success criteria:** All six statements are given correctly. (There is no "work" required on this one.)



## :new: Learning Target 4

> I can construct truth tables for propositions involving two or three atomic propositions and use truth tables to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent.

1. Construct a truth table for $p \rightarrow (q \vee r)$. 
2. Construct truth tables for $\neg (p \vee q)$ and for $(\neg p) \wedge (\neg q)$. Based on the truth tables, are these two statements logically equivalent? 

**Success criteria:** All truth tables have the correct number of rows with no duplicated rows. All intermediate columns are shown. No more than three total errors are permitted. (If you make a mistake in an intermediate column but the rest of the row is correct given that mistake, then the mistake only counts once.) The answer about whether the last two statements are logically equivalent is clearly indicated and is consistent with the truth table results.
