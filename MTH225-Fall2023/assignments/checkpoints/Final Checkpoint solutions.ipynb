    "- **Or interpreting part 2 as a license plate problem with two slots to fill and 5 ways to fill each slot**. This allows for the same person to be hired twice. Misinterpreting the problem this way should lead to a count of $5^2 = 25$ but somehow every time it happened the count was calculated as $2^5 = 32$ instead. So that's another error: $2^5$ is what you get if there are five blanks and two choices per blank, like a 5-bit string.\n",
