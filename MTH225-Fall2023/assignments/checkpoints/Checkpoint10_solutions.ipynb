    "- Writing the converse as \"*We print an error statement if the input is greater than 5*\". This is the same common error as from Checkpoint 9: It's not the converse, it's just the original conditional statement with the words appearing in different places. The hypothesis (\"the input is greater than 5\") is the same on both, and the conclusion (\"print an error statement\") is the same on both. That makes them the same logical statements. \n",
    "- **Failing to join the two parts of the negation with \"and\".** Variations include \"*The input is greater than 5. No error statement was printed.*\" (that is, making the parts into separate sentences); or \"*The input is greater than 5, no error statement was printed.*\" (using a comma instead of the word \"and\"). **You must use *and* to connect the parts** because the negation of $P \\rightarrow Q$ (\"If $P$, then $Q$\") is $P \\wedge (\\neg Q)$ (\"$P$ and not $Q$\"). Any other formulation is ambiguous. For example the comma in \"*The input is greater than 5, no error statement was printed.*\" could mean \"and\"; but it could also mean \"or\", or \"because\", or \"therefore\". This is why your English teacher warned you about [comma splices](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma-splice/). \n",
    "- **Attempting to use \"if\" and \"and\" at the same time in the negation**, like this: *If the input is greater than 5, and don't print an error statement*. This sentence does not make sense. The negation of $P \\rightarrow Q$ (\"If $P$, then $Q$\") is $P \\wedge (\\neg Q)$ (\"$P$ and not $Q$\") --- not \"If $P$ and not $Q$\". \n",

    "- **Using a starting index of $n=1$ instead of $n=0$**: The instructions say \"*Assume that the starting index is $0$*\". A number of submissions used a starting index of $1$ instead. If that choice of indexing caused the answers for closed-form and recursive formulas to produce an incorrect sequence, it was considered a non-\"simple\" error. For example in part 1, if you started indexing at $n=1$ and gave $a(n) = 4(1.5)^n$ as the closed formula, this is now an incorrect answer because the sequence that is produced is $6, 9, 13, \\dots$ -- it doesn't have the right first term. However if you changed your formula so that the right sequence is produced, for example $a(n) = 4(1.5)^{n-1}$, then it was considered correct. **To make things simple, make sure to follow directions!** As we do in class, we will assume zero indexing on everything unless stated otherwise. \n",
    "- **Stating that yor starting index is $n=0$ but the formula assumes the starting index is $n=1$**: Related, if it says in your recursive definition that the initial index is $n=0$ but the formulas don't produce the right sequence for $n=0$, this is considered an incorrect formula. For example if you said in part 1 that $a_0 = 4$ (which is stating that the starting index is $0$) but then gave a closed formula of $a(n) = 4(1.5)^{n-1}$, this is incorrect because when evaluated at $n=0$, this gives $a(0) = 4(1.5)^{-1} = \\frac{8}{3}$. **Make sure to check your work using the indices that you said you were using** to make sure the correct sequence is produced.
