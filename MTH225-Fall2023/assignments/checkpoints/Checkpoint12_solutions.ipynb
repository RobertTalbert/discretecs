All we are doing in the inductive hypothesis is assuming that $P(k)$ is true, and all we are doing in the inductive step is stating that we want to prove that $P(k+1)$ is true. Look to the predicate $P(n)$ that you identified in step 1 and just write out the expressions that result when you find $P(k)$ and $P(k+1)$. "

That number is the number who plan on majoring in math (14), plus the number who plan on majoring in CS (also 14), minus the number who plan on majoring in both. This last number is what we're looking for; call it $x$. So the number planning on majoring in math or CS is $14 + 14 - x$ or $28-x$. Putting this all together we have \n",
