# MTH 225: Checkpoint 1

Welcome to your first Checkpoint. This quiz contains two problems, one for **Learning Target 1** and another for **Learning Target 2**. Each problem is an opportunity to give a *successful demonstration of skill* on the Learning Target as described in the syllabus. A successful demonstration of skill on a Learning Target here will move you to "Level 1" on that target. 

**Instructions**: 

* You do not need to work both problems if you do not feel ready to do so. Checkpoint 2 next week will provide another attempt on each. 
* **A basic scientific or graphing calculator is the only technology allowed**. If you are using a smartphone app as your calculator, your phone *must* be switched to airplane mode. The use of any other technology, or phone apps with internet enabled, will be treated as academic dishonesty. 
* **You are not allowed any notes** on Checkpoints. 
* **Do all work on separate pages.** Note that space is *not* provided below for your work. 
* **Put each Learning Target on its own page.** Please *do not* put both Learning Targets on the same page as this will interfere with the grading and return process. If you need two sides of a page for a single target, that's fine; but do not put two Learning Targets on the same piece of paper. 
* Make sure to **put your name on each page you are handing in.**
* Note that each problem has *Success Criteria* listed. These are the standards for what constitutes a "successful" demonstration of skill. Make sure to read through those criteria and double check your work against them before turning in your work.

## Learning Target 1

> I can convert a positive integer from base 10 to base 2, 8, and 16 and vice versa and represent a negative integer in base 2 using two's complement notation. 

Be sure to *show your work* and please *put a circle or box around each answer*. 

1. Convert the base 10 integer $222$ to binary (base 2) using the base conversion algorithm. (On this part, you *must* use the base conversion algorithm and no other method.)
2. Convert the base 8 integer $277$ to base 10.  
3. Convert the base 2 integer `1101 0110` to base 16. 
4. The 8-bit binary representation of the base 10 integer $77$ is `01001101`. Write the 8-bit binary representation of $-77$ using two's complement. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. Up to two "simple errors" (as described in the *Standards for Student Work* document) are allowed. The first part must use the base conversion algorithm we learned in class. 



## Learning Target 2

> (**CORE**) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide positive integers in base 2. 



1. Add the base-2 integers `10011100` and `0110111`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
2. Subtract the base-2 integers `10011100` and `0110111`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
3. Multiply the base-2 integers `11011` and `110`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
4. Divide the base-2 integer `11001101` by `110`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. Up to two "simple errors" (as described in the *Standards for Student Work* document) are allowed.
