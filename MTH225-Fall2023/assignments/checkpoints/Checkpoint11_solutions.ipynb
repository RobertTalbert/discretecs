A conditional statement outlines a \"cause and effect\" relationship with the hypothesis being the \"cause\" and the conclusion is the \"effect\". Often the hypothesis is indicated by \"if\", as with an `if-then-else` loop in a program. **Just because \"it's Wednesday\" occurs at the end of the sentence, it's not automatically the conclusion.** \n",
