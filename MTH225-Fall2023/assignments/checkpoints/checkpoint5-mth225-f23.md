# MTH 225: Checkpoint 5

This quiz contains new instances of problems for Learning Targets 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 along the first appearances of problems for Learning Targets 8 and 9. Learning Target 4 has exited the rotation. 

**Starting with this checkpoint, CORE targets are required to be done in class, but non-CORE targets can be started in class then finished later.** Of the Learning Targets on this checkpoint, only Learning Target 5 is non-Core. Please see your announcements for complete submission instructions on this Learning Target.

Each problem is an opportunity to give a *successful demonstration of skill* on the Learning Target as described in the syllabus. A successful demonstration of skill on a Learning Target here will move you to "Level 1" on that target. 

**Instructions**: 

* You do not need to work both problems if you do not feel ready to do so. Checkpoint 2 next week will provide another attempt on each. 
* **A basic scientific or graphing calculator is the only technology allowed**. If you are using a smartphone app as your calculator, your phone *must* be switched to airplane mode. The use of any other technology, or phone apps with internet enabled, will be treated as academic dishonesty. 
* **You are not allowed any notes** on Checkpoints. 
* **Do all work on separate pages.** Note that space is *not* provided below for your work. 
* **Put each Learning Target on its own page.** Please *do not* put both Learning Targets on the same page as this will interfere with the grading and return process. If you need two sides of a page for a single target, that's fine; but do not put two Learning Targets on the same piece of paper. 
* Make sure to **put your name on each page you are handing in.**
* Note that each problem has *Success Criteria* listed. These are the standards for what constitutes a "successful" demonstration of skill. Make sure to read through those criteria and double check your work against them before turning in your work. 



## Learning Target 2

> (**CORE**) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide positive integers in base 2. 



1. Add the base-2 integers `10010111` and `01010101`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
2. Subtract the base-2 integers `10010111 and ` `01010101`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
3. Multiply the base-2 integers `1010` and `101`. **Show your work and circle your answer**. 
4. Divide the base-2 integer `11010` by `11`. **Show your work and circle your answers**. 

**Success criteria:** All four answers are correct, and the work leading to each answer is clear and legible. **All arithmetic must be done entirely in base 2 without converting to base 10 first.** Up to two "simple errors" (as described in the *Standards for Student Work* document) are allowed. 



## Learning Target 3

> (**CORE**) I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, inverse, and negation.

Consider the statement: *If the speed of the bus is under 50 mph, the bus will explode.* State, in clear English: 

1. The hypothesis of the statement
2. The conclusion of the statement
3. The converse of the statement
4. The contrapositive of the statement
5. The inverse of the statement
6. The negation of the statement (Do not just put "not" or "it is not the case that" in front of the statement)

**Success criteria:** All six statements are given correctly. (There is no "work" required on this one.)



## Learning Target 5

> I can determine the truth value of a predicate at a specific input, the truth value of a quantified predicate, and the negation of a quantified predicate.



**This Learning Target is non-Core and may be completed outside of class, provided the work is submitted on Blackboard by 11:59pm.** Please see today's announcement for details. 



1. Let $P$ and $Q$ be these two predicates. Assume the domain of each is the set of all natural numbers: $\mathbb{N} = \{0,1,2,3,4,\dots\}$ 

   - $P(x)$: $x^2$ is odd

   - $Q(x)$: $x/2$ is a natural number 

     For each of the following, state whether the expression is **TRUE** or whether it is **FALSE**. 

     (a) $P(11)$ 

     (b) $Q(10)$ 

     (c) $\exists x (\neg P(x))$ 

     (d) $\forall x (Q(x))$ 

2. Consider the statement: *Some bass guitars have five strings.* State the negation of this statement, without merely putting the word "not" or the phrase "it is not the case that" in front of the statement; that is, phrase the negation in terms of another quantified statement. 

**Success criteria:** At least three of the answers in the first part are correct; and the negation in the second part is correct and clearly stated. (No intermediate work is required.)



## Learning Target 6

> (**CORE**) I can determine elements of a recursively-defined sequence using a recurrence relation and derive a recurrence relation for a recursively-defined sequence.



1. Consider the sequence of numbers $a_n$ given by the recursive formula $a_0 = 4$, and for $n \geq  1$, $a_n = a_{n–1} +n^2$. Find the values of $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ and $a_5$. Show your work on each calculation. 
2. Consider the sequence of numbers: $2, 10, 50, 250, 1250 \dots$. If $a_0 = 2$, give a recurrence relation that generates the rest of the sequence. (Do *not* give a closed formula, but a recursive definition. The base case is $a_0 = 2$.) 

**Success criteria:** On the first part, the recursive formula must be used correctly with the correct base cases, and the mathematical work leading to the answers must be shown. On the second part, the recurrence relation must be recursive (not a closed formula) and correctly generate the terms of the sequence. No "work" is required on the second part. No more than two simple errors are allowed total. 



## Learning Target 7

> (**CORE**) Given a statement to prove using mathematical induction, I can state the framework of a proof. (Identify the predicate, identify and prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and state what needs to be proven in the inductive step)



Suppose we want to prove the following statement using mathematical induction: 

> For all natural numbers $n \geq 1$, $n < 2^n$. 



1. Write out the predicate involved in this statement: $P(n)$ says…
2. What value of $n$ corresponds to the base case? 
3. Prove that the base case holds, by direct computation or demonstration. 
4. Clearly state the inductive hypothesis without using the notation "$P(n)$". 
5. Clearly state what needs to be proven in the inductive step. Do not use the notation "$P(n)$" . You do NOT have to actually prove this statement; just state it. 



**Success criteria:** The predicate is correctly identified and does not include a quantifier. The correct value of $n$ for the base case is identified. The proof of the base case is clearly written and is correct. The inductive hypothesis is correctly and clearly stated and does not include "$P(n)$". The statement to be proven in the inductive step is correctly and clearly stated and does not include "$P(n)$". 



## :new: Learning Target 8

> (**CORE**) I can convert a set given in roster notation to set-builder notation and vice versa; and determine if an object is an element of the set.



1. Here are three sets written in set-builder notation. For each, if the set is written using correct set syntax, rewrite it using roster notation, listing *all* the elements if there are fewer than five elements, and listing *at least five* if there are more than five elements. If the set is written using incorrect syntax, write **INCORRECT SYNTAX**. 

   a) $\{x \in \{1,2,3,\dots, 20\} \, : \, x \% 5 = 0\}$   (Reminder: "$a \% b$ " means divide $a$ by $b$ and return the remainder. For example $11 \% 4 = 3$.)

   b) $\{x^2 \, : \, \{x \in \{1,2,3,\dots, 20\}\}$

   c) $\{x \, \text{is even} \, : \, \{x \in \{1,2,3,\dots, 20\}\}$

2. Rewrite the set $S = \{3, 13, 23, 33, 43, \dots\}$  using set-builder notation. There is more than one way to do this correctly; your answer must equal $S$ and must use correct set notation and syntax. You may not use "$\{x \, : x \in S \}$" as an answer. 



**Success criteria:** On the first part, all sets with incorrect syntax must be indicated; sets with correct syntax must have the indicated number of elements shown, and no more than two errors may be present in the elements. On the second part, the set must equal $S$ and the syntax of the set notation must be correct. 



## :new: Learning Target 9

> (**CORE**) I can find the intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference, power set, cardinality, cartesian product, and complement of sets.



Let $A = \{0,1,2,3,4,5\}$, $B = \{2,4,6,8\}$, and $C = \{4,8\}$ and suppose the universal set is $U = \{0,1,2,\dots, 10\}$. Find each of the following. You do not need to show intermediate steps, but this is often helpful for you (and for the person grading your work). 

1. $A \cap C$
2. $A \cup B$
3. $A \setminus C$ 
4. $\overline{B}$ 
5. $(A \cap B) \cup C$ 
6. $\emptyset \cap ((A \cup B) \cup \overline{C})$
7. ${\cal{P}}(C)$ 
8. $|B \times C|$



**Success criteria:** The final two items are correct; and at least 5 of the first 6 are correct.
