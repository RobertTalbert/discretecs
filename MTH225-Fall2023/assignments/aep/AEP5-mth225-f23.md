# AEP 5: Battle of the Bots

## Overview 

Counting problems can be complex, and they always involve careful thinking and engagement with a problem rather than throwing formulas at it. It might be tempting, when working on a counting problem -- especially one that will be graded -- to pose the problem to one of the several generative artificial intelligence applications that are now freely available, and use their response as your own. This is a terrible idea it turns out, and in this AEP you will see why, and use your uniquely human brain to set the record straight. 
 

**Initial deadline**: **Sunday, November 19 at 11:59pm ET**. You are allowed to spend one token to extend this deadline by 48 hours.  

## Background

Generative AI applications like ChatGPT are turning higher education on its head today. On the one hand, these tools can be extremely valuable for helping us humans do work that requires human thought, and it would be crazy not to use them. For example, I (Talbert) use ChatGPT all the time to help me find commands and functions in Python, R, or Julia that allow me to get things done that would otherwise require hours of searching through documentation. (And I've been known to make  ChatGPT draft committee reports that I don't want to write.)

On the other hand: For students, it can be tempting to use AI to commit academic dishonesty by letting the AI answer questions and then only slightly rewording the responses, or even copying the results outright. This is a problem for a number of moral reasons, but on a more practical level, it's a terrible idea to lean this heavily on AI because **AI is wrong a lot**. 

In this AEP, I took three counting problems from [the optional textbook for this course](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/dmoi.html), problems that appear as exercises but for which no hints or solutions were given. These are the sort of problems that an unscrupulous student might give to an AI to solve if assigned as homework. Each one was entered --- exactly as they appeared in the textbook with only minor format changes --- into three popular AI apps: ChatGPT, Bard AI (Google's AI assistant), and Bing Chat (Microsoft's AI assistant). **And in all but one case, each AI gave different answers --- along with extremely clear and incredibly plausible-looking explanations.** In in the remaining case, Bard and Bing gave the same answer, which was different than ChatGPT's; and the explanations were different. 

These AI's can't all be right! But they could all be wrong. Your job on this AEP is to pick one of these problems, analyze the solutions that the AI's gave, and decide which --- if any! --- is correct, and explain where the others went wrong. This is something only humans (so far?) can do. 


## Tasks for this AEP

As noted above, three different counting problems were posed to three different AI applications. The problems, and the outputs from the AI's, are on this document: 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZCKiKd3Uh4bAtFZH0YUnGD2ASrYOr__jG5TNzzv_4o/edit?usp=sharing

**Note**: Commenting permissions for this document are enabled for everyone, so if you have a clarifying question to ask, then highlight the text you're asking about and then hit `Command-Option-M` on a Mac or `Control-Alt-M` on Windows to create a comment where you can pose your question; or go to `Insert > Comment` in the menus. 

Each counting problem is taken from your optional textbook, entirely verbatim except for minor format changes, and entered exactly the same to each AI. The output, again with only minor format changes, is shown on the document. 

**Choose EXACTLY ONE (1) of the counting problems and its AI responses from the document.** (You should look through all three, but only pick one to focus on.) Study the question being asked and the AI responses. Then: 

1. Decide which AI response, *if any*, is correct. **Importantly:** They cannot all be correct, but it's possible that none of them are! If this is the case, make sure this is clearly stated. 
2. Go through each *incorrect* response and analyze the AI's explanation. Point out where the AI went wrong and explain why it's wrong. (See below for how to do this and how *not* to do this.)
3. Also find the *right* answer for the counting problem and give a complete, correct solution to it --- or if one of the AI's has given a complete, correct solution, go through it and explain how you know it's right. 
4. When you're done with tasks 1 and 2, write a final paragraph that talks about what you learned in this AEP in terms of using AI to solve math problems. You might consider questions such as: What are the uses of AI in solving complex math problems like these? What are its limitations? What are the pitfalls to watch out for? What is the role of the human being in solving these problems? And anything else that comes to mind. There's no minimum word count, etc. -- hopefully this assignment has sparked some curiosity and realizations in your mind, so just write what you are thinking about. (But, do make your writing clear and intelligible.)


Here are some important notes about how to go about these tasks: 

- Please note, if you re-enter the question to the same AI you might get a different response! (Another reason to be careful using these things.) So in doing your analysis of the AI repsonses, **stick to the responses that are on the document and do not re-enter the prompt**. 
- **Your reasoning about the AI responses should eventually be **conceptual** in nature, which means that you should explain *why* the reponse is correct or incorrect.** Don't simply *demonstrate that* the response is correct or incorrect. For example you could potentially find the right answer to one of these counting problems by writing code that would explicitly list all the things being counted, and then just finding the length of the output. This would provide proof that a wrong answer is wrong and a right answer is right, but it would not explain *why the explanation is wrong or right*. An insufficient explanation for a wrong AI response, for example, is "I wrote a program and it gave me the right answer". Responses that don't explain why, will be returned for revision without further comment. 



## Expectations and Grading Criteria 

When it comes to **explanations**: 

- **Keep it simple and clear.** Do not assume that the reader is a genius, has lots of experience shared with you, or wants to fill in any gaps you leave. Use plain language and make your explanations as clear as possible. 
- **General statements are not explained by examples.** For example if you think a function is injective, it means that there are no collisions from the input to the output. Explaining this, requires that you explain why collisions **never** happen with this function; a single, specific example of a collision not happening isn't convincing. However, remember that if a function **is not** injective, or is not surjective, then this *can* be explained with a single example where the property fails, so you can give that example and explain why it works. 
- **Remember the audience**. The audience is **your classmates** --- people who are smart and have all the background knowledge that a regular person in the class would have, but none of the specialized knowledge that *you* have, and no experience with your particular problem. At regular intervals, stop and ask yourself if, honestly, your explanation would be clear and convincing for that audience. If not, keep working on it. 

And remember: **The main criteria used for evaluating your work on this and most other AEPs is the *quality of your explanations, not the correctness of your answers***. It's pretty easy to get right answers; but it takes real understanding to explain why they are right. 

Remember the general expectations and grading standards for AEPs are in the [Standards for Student Work](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Fall2023/course-docs/standards-mth225-f23.md#standards-for-aeps) document. Make sure to review this before submitting anything and use those guidelines as a checklist to save yourself time and energy later from having to revise work that doesn't meet those standards. 



## Submitting your work 

**AEP submissions must be typewritten and saved as either a PDF or MS Word file. No part of your submission may involve handwriting; work that is submitted that contains handwriting will be graded N and returned without feedback.** This includes electronic handwritten docments, for example using a stylus and a note-taking app. To type up your work, you can use MS Word or Google Docs (both of which have equation editors for mathematical notation) or any other computer-based math typesetting tool. Just make sure you save your work as a Word document or PDF (no `.odt`, `.rtf`, or other file extensions are allowed).

When you have your work typed up, double-check it for neatness, correctness, and clarity. Then simply submit your document on Blackboard, in the **AEP** area, in the **AEP 5** assignment. 

There are no special additional criteria for this AEP. Although there is code to analyze in this AEP, you do not need to *write* any code for it, so a Jupyter notebook isn't necessary. If you choose to use a Jupyter notebook anyway, that's OK, just remember to set permissions on your document correctly ("Everyone with the link can comment") and turn in the link, not a PDF. 


## Getting Help

You **may** ask me (Talbert) for help on this assignment in the form of **specific mathematical or technical questions, or clarifying questions about the instructions**. If I cannot answer a question because it would give too much away, I'll tell you so. However please note: **I will not "look over your work" before you submit it to give you feedback on the overall submission**. I have made the expectations clear, so just follow those directions and submit your best work, and you'll be allowed to revise it if needed. 

For AEPs, the syllabus policy on collaboration is: 

>On AEPs, you are allowed to engage in general discussions of strategy only with others, but no collaboration on the details of a problem are allowed..
 
**You can ask technology related questions to anyone at any time**. For example if you need help figuring out how to type up your work, there are no restrictions on that.
