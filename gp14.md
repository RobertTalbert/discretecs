# MTH 225 Guided Practice 1.4: Binary Representation of Positive Integers

## Overview

In what might seem like a departure from our study of sets, we're going to look in this lesson on a singularly important math topic for CS: how to represent positive integers in _binary_ or _base 2_ notation. Binary is the basic language of numbers with computers, because computers only understand two states (on/off, true/false). This lesson will also give us our first brush with a somewhat complex _algorithm_. 


## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

+ Given a positive integer in decimal form, convert it to binary form. 
+ Given a positive integer in binary form, convert it decimal form. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Trace through the steps of Algorithm 1.4.1 for converting decimal to binary, and modify the algorithm to work in an alternative setting. 

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Applied Discrete Structures_, read Section 1.4. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos.

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

1. Convert the following positive integers from decimal to binary: 24, 31, 32, 1025. __NOTE__: Although you're only required to put the answers in the blanks on the submission form, you should do all your work in your notes. What's important here is not the answer (because correctness doesn't matter at this point) but whether you are wrestling with the concepts and processes. So make sure you are _doing_ the work and _recording_ your work in your notes. 
2. Convert the following positive integers from binary to decimal: 1011, 100110, 11100111. 
3. Make up several examples of _even_ positive integers and convert them to binary. What patterns do you notice in the bits (i.e. the individual zeroes and ones that make up the binary string)? (Note: You don't have to do these conversions by hand unless you need practice; you can use [this website](http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-binary-converter) for instance, or [Wolfram|Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com) ([here's an example](http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-binary-converter)), or the `DEC2BIN` command in Microsoft Excel/Google Spreadsheets.)
4. Repeat question 3 except use odd integers.
