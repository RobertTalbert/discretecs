MTH 202 Chapter 7 topic list -- DRAFT
=====================================

## 7.1: An Introduction to Differential Equations

+ Quick review
+ Example: Expressing exponential growth as a differential equation (similar to Activity 7.1)
+ Example: Checking to verify that a function does (or does not) solve a differential equation (given something like dy/dt = y^2 + y, and two functions f(t) and g(t) where f is a solution but g is not)

## 7.2: Qualitative behavior of solutions to DE's

+ Quick review
+ Example: Generating a slope field of a DE (by hand)
+ Example: Generating a slope field of a DE (using technology -- can Geogebra do this?)   
+ Example: Drawing solutions to an initial-value problem given the slope field (draw several examples, using the same DE but different initial values)
+ Example: Finding equilibrium solutions to an autonomous DE


## 7.3: Euler's Method

+ Quick review
+ Example of using Euler's method 

(Other Euler's method examples could be done -- e.g. using Excel, using a bad choice for \Delta t that leads to incorrect solutions, etc.)

## 7.4: Separable differential equations

+ Quick review
+ Example: Solving dy/dt = ky for some real number k
+ Example: Solving dy/dt = k(y + a) for some k, a
+ Also include 1--2 more examples of separable DE's that are not the same as the above

## 7.5: Modeling with differential equations

+ Quick review
+ Example: Mixing problem (like Preview Activity 7.5(b))
+ Example: Compounding interest (like Activity 7.11)


## 7.6: Population growth and the logistic equation

+ Quick review
+ Example: Setup of a logistic equation using a population problem
+ Example: Solving a logistic DE
