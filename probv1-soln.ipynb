    "1a) Since A and B are mutually exclusive, they cannot happen at the same time and so $p(A \\cap B) = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Question: Why don't we just multiply the probabilities together?_ This is what we do if the events are __independent__. This means that the outcome of one does not affect or depend upon the outcome of the other. But this is different than being __mutually exclusive__. For example, if we roll two dice -- one blue, one red -- let $A$ be the event that we roll 2 on blue, and $B$ the event that we roll 3 on red. These events are certainly _independent_ because the result of the blue die roll has no effect on the result of the red one. But they are _not_ mutually exclusive, because certainly they could both happen. \n",

    "1b) Since A and B are mutually exclusive, $p(A \\cup B) = p(A) + p(B) = 0.9$. \n",

    "The probability that the die rolls never come up even is the same as the probability that the die rolls always come up odd. There is a $1/2$ probability of each of the six rolls coming up odd, and each die roll is independent of the others. Therefore the probability of always coming up odd on six rolls is $(1/2)^6 = 1/64$. As mentioned, this is the same as the probability of never coming up even. \n",

Similarly the other two rolls are also at a probability of $1/49$. The outcomes are mutually exclusive, so the probability of getting any one of them is $1/49 + 1/49 + 1/49 = 3/49$ or about $0.06122$. \n",
