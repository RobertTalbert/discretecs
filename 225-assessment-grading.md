# Draft of assessment ideas for MTH 225

Work that is assessed: 

+ Checkpoints (biweekly, for Learning Target mastery) 
+ AEP (like in 201)
+ Daily Prep (pre-module)
  + Twice a week -- before M and before W -- focuses on just the lesson for the day, includes review 
+ Activities 
  + Given in three flavors -- synchronous and asynchronous
  + Assigned on ClassKick 
  + Whatever modality you choose, just get it done by 11:59pm T (for M class) or R (for W class) 
  + Graded check/x on basis of completeness and effort 
+ Weekly Practice 
  + Two parts, one assignment -- give some choice, pick N of M in each part 
  + Write up on paper or type, submit on Bb
  + Graded EMRN  
  + Includes weekly check-in (for engagement credit) 
+ Final exam (big picture + additional checkpoint)

## Draft of grading system 

+ 23 regular Learning Targets, 10 of which designated Core
+ 3 "CS" learning targets for process
  + CS.1 satisfied by: 
    + Earning E on at least 3 AEPs or
    + Earning E on at least 6 LAs or
    + Getting two checks through combination of oral exams or videos 
  + CS.2 is satisfied by completing the CodeAcademy Python course and "M" on any programming-focused AEP. 
  + CS.3 is satisfied by successfully revising at least 3 AEP's to raise the grade; AEP's starting at N do not count without permission. 
+ At least 8 AEP 
+ 12 GP 
+ 12 Module LA's 
+ Maybe 100 EC's 

| Grade | Core Targets | Supplemental Targets | CS Targets | AEP | GP | LA | EC |

Plus for having all requirements for base grade AND AEP or LT for next level up AND pass the big picture portion of the final. 

Minus for: 

- All requirements except one satisfied, and the one is no more than two grade levels lower
- No Pass on the big picture portion of the final
