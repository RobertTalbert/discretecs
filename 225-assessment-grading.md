# Draft of assessment ideas for MTH 225

Work that is assessed: 

+ Checkpoints (biweekly, for Learning Target mastery) 
+ AEP (like in 201)
+ Daily Prep (pre-module)
  + Twice a week -- before M and before W -- focuses on just the lesson for the day, includes review 
+ Activities 
  + Given in three flavors -- synchronous and asynchronous
  + Assigned on ClassKick 
  + Whatever modality you choose, just get it done by 11:59pm T (for M class) or R (for W class) 
  + Graded check/x on basis of completeness and effort 
+ Weekly Practice 
  + Two parts, one assignment -- give some choice, pick N of M in each part 
  + Write up on paper or type, submit on Bb
  + Graded EMRN  
  + Includes weekly check-in (for engagement credit) 
+ Final exam (big picture + additional checkpoint)

---

+ Items for engagement credit  
  + Completing in-class work on ClassKick
  + Guided practice
  + Weekly check-ins
  + Python unit 
  + Startup activity
  + Helping on CampusWire
  + LT/AEP incentives


## Draft of grading system 

+ 23 regular Learning Targets, 10 of which designated Core
+ 3 "CS" learning targets for process
  + CS.1 satisfied by: 
    + Earning E on at least 3 AEPs or
    + Earning E on at least 6 LAs or
    + Getting two checks through combination of oral exams or videos 
  + CS.2 is satisfied by completing the CodeAcademy Python course and "M" on any programming-focused AEP. 
  + CS.3 is satisfied by successfully revising at least 3 AEP's to raise the grade; AEP's starting at N do not count without permission. 
+ At least 8 AEP 
+ 12 GP 
+ 12 Module LA's 
+ Maybe 100 EC's 

| Grade | Core Targets | Supplemental Targets | CS Targets | AEP | GP | LA | EC | 
|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: | 
A | Mastery 10 | Mastery 6, Progressing 5 | Satisfy 3 | 3 E, 4 M+ | 10 | 10 | 90 
B | Mastery 10 | Mastery 4, Progressing 5  | Satisfy 3 | 1 E, 5 M+ | 8 | 8 | 80 | 
C | Mastery 5, Progressing 5 |  Mastery 2, Progressing 5 | Satisfy 2 | 4 M+ | 6 | 6 | 70 
D | Progressing 5 | Progressing 5 | n/a | 2 M+ | 4 | 4 |  50 


Plus for having all requirements for base grade AND AEP or LT for next level up AND pass the big picture portion of the final. 

Minus for: 

- All requirements except one satisfied, and the one is no more than two grade levels lower
- No Pass on the big picture portion of the final 


## Second draft of grading system 

Assessed work: 

+ Learning Targets assessed through Checkpoints: 23 in all -- 10 Core, 13 supplemental
+ "CS" learning targets assessed through special means -- 3 total
+ AEP --- at least 8 of these, probably more 
+ Learning activities --- Either Daily Prep or Class Activities, 1 point each (check/x) and about 24 of each total for a grand total of 48
+ Weekly Practice sets --- basically homework, graded EMRN (but the E is just feedback) 

| Grade | Core Targets | Supplemental Targets | CS Targets | AEP | LA | WP | 
|:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |:--: |
A | 10 Mastery | 6 Proficient, 5 Mastery | 3 | 3 E, 4 M+ | 44 | 9 M+ |
B | 10 Mastery | 5 Proficient, 4 Mastery | 3 | 1 E, 4 M+ | 39 | 8 M+ | 
C | 5 Mastery, 5 Proficient | 7 Proficient | 2 | 5 M+ | 34 | 7 M+ | 
D | 5 Proficient | 5 Proficient | n/a | 2 M+ | 24 | 4 M+ | 


F = Not all requirements for a D are satisfied

Plus/minus rules: 

+ Earn a plus if: 
  + Complete all the requirements for a base grade and any of the Targets or AEP requirements for the next level up AND earn Passing mark on the big-picture portion of the final exam. 
+ Earn a minus if: 
  + Do not pass the big-picture portion of the final; OR 
  + Complete all requirements for a base grade except for one, and that one is no more than two grade levels lower
