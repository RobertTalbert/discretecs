# Learning Outcomes for MTH 325

## Global notes 

+ "State all the definitions and mathematical results from this section" is a learning outcome for _every_ section. 

## Chapter 8: Relations

### 8.1: Relations and their Properties

+ Determine the ordered pairs in a relation from A to B (or from A to A) if the relation is given as a set in set-builder notation, in symbolic form, or in a diagram form. 
+ Determine whether a given relation is reflexive, symmetric, antisymmetric, or transitive. 
+ Given a relation from A to B and a relation from B to C, determine the ordered pairs in the composite of the two relations. 

### 8.2: n-ary Relations and their Applications

Potentially skip this section or save it for the application project. 

### 8.3: Representing Relations

Will need to review matrices (3.8) and do some Sage work before this. 

+ Given a relation from A to B, write the relation as a matrix. Conversely given the matrix for a relation from A to B, write out the ordered pairs in the relation. 
+ Determine whether a relation from A to B is symmetric or antisymmetric using its matrix. 
+ Find matrices representing the union and intersection of two relations. 
+ Find a matrix representing the composite of two relations. 
+ Given a relation from A to B, write the relation as a directed graph (digraph). Conversely given the digraph for a relation from A to B, write out the ordered pairs in the relation. 
+ Determine the properties held by a relation by investigating its digraph. 

### 8.4: Closures of Relations

+ Determine the reflexive closure of a relation on a set A. 
+ Determine the symmetric closure of a relation on a set A. 
+ Determine the transitive closure of a relation on a set A using a digraph or a matrix. 
+ Determine the transitive closure of a relation on a set A using Algorithm 1 and using Warshall's Algorithm. 

### 8.5: Equivalence Relations

+ Determine whether a relation on a set is an equivalence relation. 
+ Given an equivalence relation on a set and an element x in that set, determine the equivalence class of x. 
+ Given an equivalence relation on a set, determine a partition of the set using the equivalence relation. Conversely, given a partition of a set, use it to define an equivalence relation on that set. 

### 8.6: Partial Orderings

+ Determine whether a relation on a set is a partial ordering. 
+ Determine whether a given partially ordered set is a total ordering. 
+ Draw the Hasse diagram for a given poset. 
+ Find: the greatest and least elements of a poset; upper and lower bounds of a subset of a poset; the least upper bound and greatest lower bound of a subset of a poset. 
+ Determine whether a poset is a lattice. 
+ Perform a topological sort of a partially ordered set. 

## Chapter 9: Graphs

### 9.1: Graphs and Graph Models

+ Determine whether a given graph is a simple graph, a multigraph, or a pseudograph. (Similarly for directed graphs.) 
+ Use a graph to model a system of interconnected nodes. 

### 9.2: Graph Terminology and Special Kinds of Graphs

+ Calculate the degree of a vertex in a graph.
+ Explain the reasoning behind the Handshaking Theorem and how the Handshaking Theorem helps to establish the other results in this section. 
+ Draw examples of complete graphs, cycle graphs, wheel graphs, and n-cube graphs. 
+ Determine if a graph is bipartite. 

### 9.3: Representing Graphs and Graph Isomorphism

+ Represent a graph as an adjacency list; and conversely given an adjacency list, draw the graph. 
+ Represent a graph as an adjacency matrix; and conversely given an adjacency matrix, draw the graph.   
+ Represent a graph as an incidence matrix; and conversely given an incidence matrix, draw the graph. 
+ Determine whether two graphs are isomorphic. If they are isomorphic, state the function that implements the isomorphism.
