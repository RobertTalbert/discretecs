# Answers: Sets Level 2, version 3

Note: There were no students attempting Sets Level 1 this time. If you would like to discuss the problems on that assessment, please contact me. 

## Sets Level 2

(1a) $B-A$ is the set of all elements of $B$ ($\{40,60,80,100,120,\dots\}$) that are not in $A$. So filter out all the powers of 10 from $B$, to get something like this: 
$$\{40,60,80,120,140,\cdots, 960, 980, 1020, 1040, \cdots\}$$

(1b) No, $C$ is not equal to $A$ because $C$ contains negative integer powers of $10$ (like $0.1$ and $0.0001$) but $A$ does not. 

(1c) No, because if $\{\emptyset\}$ were a subset of $B$, it would mean that $\emptyset$ is an _element_ of $B$, which it is not -- because $B$ consists of numbers and $\emptyset$ is not a number. 

(2a) $\sum_{i = 1}^4 3^i$

(2b) $\sum_{i=1}^6 (0.1)^i$
