Specifications for Student Work in MTH 325
==========================================

# Specifications for writing (general) 

In addition to particular specifications that might be given in the Learning Module itself (for example, a minimum word count), all written work -- including writing that is part of a mathematical calculation or proof -- must abide by the following: 

+ Your writing must be almost entirely free, if not entirely free, of spelling errors. 
+ Your writing must be almost entirely free, if not entirely free, of the following basic grammatical errors: 
    * Incomplete sentences
    * Subject-verb disagreement 
    * Misuse of punctuation (periods, commas, apostrophes, etc.) 
    * Use of slang or inappropriate abbreviations (for example, abbreviating "directed graph" as "dir. graph")
+ Your writing must be clear to a member of the standard audience for this course, which is assumed to be __a peer in MTH 325 who is knowledgeable of the content of the course but who may not be familiar with what you are writing about.__ 

# Specifications for mathematical writing

When writing a solution to a mathematical problem, or writing a narrative that contains significant mathematical notation in it, your work should abide by the general specifications for writing above _and_ the following: 

+ The solution to a mathematical problem must be correct, and the steps in the solution must also be correct. (So, getting a right answer by sheer coincidence when the solution is wrong is not acceptable.)
+ Solutions to mathematical problems should be framed as efforts to persuade a member of the standard MTH 325 audience (above) that your solution and answers are correct. This means among other things that 
    * Your writing must be clear, well organized, and contain no significant gaps in the reasoning in a solution. In particular, answers without sufficient work are not accepted. 
    * Your writing must keep the reader informed at all times. For example, if you are about to perform a computation, explain what you are going to do first in a short sentence. Also there must be a clear indicator of when the solution is finished. 
+ Additionally, mathematical writing should abide by the following format specifications: 
    * Sentences should not begin with variables. (Wrong: "deg(v) represents the degree of a vertex." Right: "We denote by deg(v) the degree of a vertex.")
    * If the answer to a problem involves units, correct units must be attached to the answer. 
    * If a problem has multiple parts, the solution must be written up in multiple parts. 
    * Mathematical notation is not to be used to replace wording in an English sentence. (Wrong: "We can see that the degree of this vertex = 5." Right: "We can see that the degree of this vertex equals 5.")
    * Use the equals sign "=" only for connecting two objects that are actually equal, not as an indicator of a step in a solution. 
    * Do not use * for multiplication or ^ for exponents. 
    * If you introduce a variable in a solution, you must first clearly state what that variable represents and then stick with that variable name throughout the solution. 


# Specifications for mathematical proof

If you are writing a mathematical proof, your work should meet all the specifications for general writing _and_ all the specifications for mathematical writing, _and_ the following: 

+ Proofs must begin with a carefully worded statement of the proposition being proved. 
+ Proofs must begin with a statement of your assumptions. 
+ Each step of a proof must be expicitly justified by references to definitions, previously-proven work (using the Section and Theorem number), or some similar designation. If a step is justified by prerequisite knowledge available to the standard MTH 325 audience (such as using the FOIL method or a law of exponents) then these steps should be shown but do not need to be justified. However you may wish to err on the side of caution if you're not sure if a step is basic enough. 
+ Proofs must end with a clear statement that the conclusions have been reached and that the proof is over. 

# Specifications for computer programs and code
 
Computer programs (such as Python functions) and Sage computations may be submitted either as part of the PDF for the module, or put into a Sage notebook and placed in a __Learning Modules__ folder in the student's SageMath Cloud account, using the same file name as the PDF. Computer work must follow these specifications: 

+ If saving as a file in your SMC account, it must be in a __Learning Modules__ folder and have a correct filename. 
+ The Sage notebook must have your name and section number at the top of the notebook in a title cell. 
+ All computer code must execute with no syntax errors. 
+ All computer code must produce the correct output. 
+ Computer code must begin with a comment section briefly explaining the code. You may either add comments into the code itself or create a Markdown cell above your code for comments. 

# Specifications for submissions of Learning Modules 

When submitting your work, the package you submit must follow these technical specifications: 

+ The completed work must be typed up using LaTeX, Microsoft Word, or some other typesetting system capable of rendering mathematical notation. Handwritten work is not accepted. 
+ The completed submission must be saved as a PDF file type. (If submitting work as a Sage notebook, see "Specifications for computer programs and code".) 
+ The file name of the submission must be exactly as specified on the Learning Module. 
+ The submission must include the student's name and section number at the beginning of the work. 
+ The solutions in the submission must be done in the order they were presented in the Learning Module. 
+ All mathematical graphical items such as directed graphs must be computer-generated and not hand drawn.
