This link is also on the Blackboard site. **We will use the Class Page for most things, and reserve Blackboard for announcements and gradebook only.** 
- **Technology requirements:** It's highly recommended to have a laptop and access to a high-speed internet connection for work outside of class. You will need a basic handheld scientific or graphing calculator for exams in class. There is no preferred model of device. For in-class technology use, please see the "Using technology during class meetings" section below.

## About MTH 225

### What MTH 225 is about and what you will learn

**All of computer science, and all of the fields that come out of computer science such as cybersecurity, are based on mathematics**. In this course and in its sequel MTH 325, you'll get a broad and deep introduction to all of the essential foundational math knowledge you need to be a successful computing professional. 

The topics you'll learn are collectively called **discrete mathematics** because they deal with mathematical objects ("structures") that can be separated and counted ("discrete"). These include: 

- *Computer arithmetic*: Integer division; the Euclidean algorithm; the modulus (`%`) operator and modular arithmetic; integer representation and arithmetic in binary, octal, and hexadecimal. 
- *Logic*: Logical propositions; conditional statements; truth tables; predicates and quantifiers; logical equivalence and valid rules of deduction. 
- *Recursion and induction*: Recurrence relations; recursively defined structures; basics of mathematical proof and proof by mathematical induction. 
- *Sets and functions*: Representation of sets; subsets; union, intersection, and differences of sets; cardinality; functions; injective, surjective, and bijective functions; basics of combinatorial proof. 
- *Counting*: Additive and Multiplicative Rules for counting; the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion; the binomial coefficient; combinations, permutations, and $k$-permutations; solving complex counting problems.

Additionally, MTH 225 and MTH 325 focus on **essential transferable skills** that will serve you throughout your careers: 

- **Critical evaluation**: Being able to look at a program, problem solution, or explanation -- especially those you create -- and find and fix errors and misconceptions in it. 
- **Deliberate practice**: Practicing a skill, not mindlessly but with focused attention and a goal of improving performance. 
- **Good explanations**: Taking a complex idea and making it make sense to a normal, non-expert human being through a clear, correct, and complete verbal explanation. 


### Official learning objectives

Upon completion of MTH 225, you will be able to: 

* Represent integers using different number bases, and perform integer arithmetic using different bases and modular arithmetic.
* Formulate, manipulate, and determine the truth of logical expressions using symbolic logic.
* Formulate and solve computational problems using sets and functions.
* Formulate and solve complex counting problems using computational thinking and the tools of combinatorics.
* Evaluate numerical and other sequences using recursion, and solve simple recurrence relations.
* Write clear, correct, and convincing arguments to explain the correctness of a solution using combinatorial proof and mathematical induction.
* Explain the reasoning behind solutions to computational problems clearly to an appropriate audience.
* Apply effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
* Apply computer programming and computational thinking to frame and solve mathematical and computational problems.
* Self-assess your work and apply feedback from others to make improvements in that work.


### What class meetings and participation look like 

Throughout the semester, you'll engage with the class in two distinct ways:

- **Before class:** Before a class meeting, you'll complete a **Class Prep** assignment that contains *review questions* from the previous class meeting, a *reading or video selection* to introduce new ideas for the next class, and *preview questions* to make sure you have the basic knowledge for the next class. Class Prep assignments are essential for being fully prepared; class meetings pick up where Class Prep assignments end, and we will not typically re-teach any material from Class Preps. 
- **During class:** A typical class will start with questions submitted in the Class Prep assignment for the day, and a warmup exercise. The bulk of class meetings will focus on *deliberate practice of a particular skill* that will eventually be assessed on an exam. We will often work in groups of 2--4 so you can tap into your classmates for help. Less frequently, class sessions will be devoted to taking exams over basic skills or homework; more on that below. There will not be much in the way of lecturing. 

You'll get the most out of the class if you attend class meetings every day and participate actively in the class activities. Good participation involves showing up for class prepared (by doing the Class Preps), interacting positively with your classmates, offering your own ideas and listening to others, and asking math questions when you are stuck. 


### How to succeed in MTH 225

**The path to success in MTH 225 is simple** (even though some of the topics are challenging). All it takes, are behaviors that are within the grasp of every student: 

- **Preparing for class** (by completing Class Preps) and **attending class meetings**. 
- **Participating actively and openly** during class meetings. 
- **Blocking off daily times** for working on the class outside of class meetings.
- **Mindful practice and work on assignments** during those daily work times. 
- **Careful understanding of feedback** on your work so that you can incorporate it into later attempts intelligently. 
- **Consistent submission of attempts** on class work, described later. 
- **Asking questions about math** in drop-in hours, class meetings, or emails when there's anything you're not sure about.  

Successful MTH 225 students have one thing in common: *They all engage in these behaviors and do these actions consistently, every day throughout the course*. Unsuccessful students typically fail to be consistent in one or more of these. **The common denominator is focus and consistency** -- you do not have to be a "math genius" to do well in MTH 225! You just have to **consistently engage with the feedback loops** that are there for you. 

**I want you to be successful in this class.** I am personally invested in each student mastering all of the skills in the course, and in your growth as a learner. I will challenge and support you, and if you engage with the learning activities and the feedback you receive, you will learn a lot and have a great experience.
