## About MTH 225

### What MTH 225 is about and what you will learn

**All of computer science, and all of the fields that come out of computer science such as cybersecurity, are based on mathematics**. In this course and in its sequel MTH 325, you'll get a broad and deep introduction to all of the essential foundational math knowledge you need to be a successful computing professional. 

The topics you'll learn are collectively called **discrete mathematics** because they deal with mathematical objects ("structures") that can be separated and counted ("discrete"). These include: 

- *Computer arithmetic*: Integer division; the Euclidean algorithm; the modulus (`%`) operator and modular arithmetic; integer representation and arithmetic in binary, octal, and hexadecimal. 
- *Logic*: Logical propositions; conditional statements; truth tables; predicates and quantifiers; logical equivalence and valid rules of deduction. 
- *Recursion and induction*: Recurrence relations; recursively defined structures; basics of mathematical proof and proof by mathematical induction. 
- *Sets and functions*: Representation of sets; subsets; union, intersection, and differences of sets; cardinality; functions; injective, surjective, and bijective functions; basics of combinatorial proof. 
- *Counting*: Additive and Multiplicative Rules for counting; the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion; the binomial coefficient; combinations, permutations, and $k$-permutations; solving complex counting problems.

Additionally, MTH 225 and MTH 325 focus on **essential transferable skills** that will serve you throughout your careers: 

- **Critical evaluation**: Being able to look at a program, problem solution, or explanation -- especially those you create -- and find and fix errors and misconceptions in it. 
- **Deliberate practice**: Practicing a skill, not mindlessly but with focused attention and a goal of improving performance. 
- **Good explanations**: Taking a complex idea and making it make sense to a normal, non-expert human being through a clear, correct, and complete verbal explanation. 


### Official learning objectives

Upon completion of MTH 225, you will be able to: 

* Represent integers using different number bases, and perform integer arithmetic using different bases and modular arithmetic.
* Formulate, manipulate, and determine the truth of logical expressions using symbolic logic.
* Formulate and solve computational problems using sets and functions.
* Formulate and solve complex counting problems using computational thinking and the tools of combinatorics.
* Evaluate numerical and other sequences using recursion, and solve simple recurrence relations.
* Write clear, correct, and convincing arguments to explain the correctness of a solution using combinatorial proof and mathematical induction.
* Explain the reasoning behind solutions to computational problems clearly to an appropriate audience.
* Apply effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
* Apply computer programming and computational thinking to frame and solve mathematical and computational problems.
* Self-assess your work and apply feedback from others to make improvements in that work.


### What class meetings and participation look like 

Throughout the semester, you'll engage with the class in two distinct ways:

- **Before class:** Before a class meeting, you'll complete a **Class Prep** assignment that contains *review questions* from the previous class meeting, a *reading or video selection* to introduce new ideas for the next class, and *preview questions* to make sure you have the basic knowledge for the next class. Class Prep assignments are essential for being fully prepared; class meetings pick up where Class Prep assignments end, and we will not typically re-teach any material from Class Preps. 
- **During class:** A typical class will start with questions submitted in the Class Prep assignment for the day, and a warmup exercise. The bulk of class meetings will focus on *deliberate practice of a particular skill* that will eventually be assessed on an exam. We will often work in groups of 2--4 so you can tap into your classmates for help. Less frequently, class sessions will be devoted to taking exams over basic skills or homework; more on that below. There will not be much in the way of lecturing. 

You'll get the most out of the class if you attend class meetings every day and participate actively in the class activities. Good participation involves showing up for class prepared (by doing the Class Preps), interacting positively with your classmates, offering your own ideas and listening to others, and asking math questions when you are stuck. 


### How to succeed in MTH 225

**The path to success in MTH 225 is simple** (even though some of the topics are challenging). All it takes, are behaviors that are within the grasp of every student: 

- **Preparing for class** (by completing Class Preps) and **attending class meetings**. 
- **Participating actively and openly** during class meetings. 
- **Blocking off daily times** for working on the class outside of class meetings.
- **Mindful practice and work on assignments** during those daily work times. 
- **Careful understanding of feedback** on your work so that you can incorporate it into later attempts intelligently. 
- **Consistent submission of attempts** on class work, described later. 
- **Asking questions about math** in drop-in hours, class meetings, or emails when there's anything you're not sure about.  

Successful MTH 225 students have one thing in common: *They all engage in these behaviors and do these actions consistently, every day throughout the course*. Unsuccessful students typically fail to be consistent in one or more of these. **The common denominator is focus and consistency** -- you do not have to be a "math genius" to do well in MTH 225! You just have to **consistently engage with the feedback loops** that are there for you. 

**I want you to be successful in this class.** I am personally invested in each student mastering all of the skills in the course, and in your growth as a learner. I will challenge and support you, and if you engage with the learning activities and the feedback you receive, you will learn a lot and have a great experience.

## How you will learn in MTH 225 

### Overall approach to assignments

In MTH 225, your learning will take place in three different, complementary categories: 

- *Mastery of basic building-block skills*, which in the course we call **Learning Targets**. 
- *Application of basic skills*, which happen through assignments labeled **Application/Analysis**. 
- *Engagement in the course*, by earning **engagement credits**. 

Here are the details on each of these. 

### Learning Targets

The basic, foundational building blocks of the course are summarized in a list of 15 **Learning Targets**. The complete list appears in Appendix A of this syllabus. Six (6) of these are highlighted as **Core Learning Targets** because they are specifically marked by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) as essential skills for all computing professionals. 

Our class is organized around the 15 Learning Targets, and we will be covering one Learning Target per week on average. Class meetings will center on practicing these Learning Targets. Four times during the semester, you will take a **Learning Target Exam** that consists of problems, one problem per Learning Target that is being covered. Each exam is cumulative: The first exam will cover Learning Targets 1--4, the second Learning Targets 1--8, and so on. For how these exams and problems are graded, see "How assignments are graded and recorded" below. 


### Application/Analysis 

To give you practice on applying the Learning Targets to more complicated problems, roughly weekly you will work through an **Application/Analysis assignment**. These are take-home assignments that include multiple choice items on terminology and concepts as well as open-ended problems involving the topics from the past week. *These are graded only on the basis of completeness and effort*, so you receive full credit if you simply respond to all of the items with a good-faith effort at being correct. You'll get a key and a video walkthrough of selections of the assignment items each time. 

Twice during the semester, you'll take an **Application/Analysis Exam**. Both of these two exams will consist of a selection of items *taken directly from the Application/Analysis assignments*. So, if you have done mindful work in doing the assignment questions correctly, or correcting your mistakes, the exam will give you the chance to demonstrate this. Information on how the Application/Analysis Exams are graded is given here, and information on revision and reattempts is given here. 


### Engagement credits

As mentioned above, success in the course really depends on consistent engagement both in and outside of class. Opportunities to do so are plentiful, and many will have a point value attached, which we call **engagement credits**. Your course grade will depend partially on how many engagement credits you accumulate. Some engagement credit opportunities are recurring (successful completion of Class Prep and Application/Analysis assignments, attending class meetings, etc.) while some are one-time opportunities that encourage going above and beyond basic engagement (for example, the Startup Assignment given in week 1, or reading an article and writing a summary). All such opportunities to earn engagement credits will be clearly announced; more details on some of these are below. 

### Final exam

We will have a final exam in the course, given at these times: 

- Section 02: Wednesday, April 23 from 8:00-9:50am
- Section 03: Monday, April 21 from 10:00-11:50am 

The final exam is planned to have two parts. Part A will consist of a reassessment on all six of the Core Learning Targets and is required for everyone. Part B will consist of new versions of all Learning Target problems and both Application/Analysis exams, and is optional, intended only for those who need a last reattempt. (More on reattempts later.)


## How your work will be graded 

### How grading works in MTH 225

Grading in MTH 225 works differently than it possibly does in your other courses and in high school. In MTH 225: 

- **Almost none of your assignments have point values**. (The exception is engagement credit items.) Therefore there is **no partial credit and no averaging** because there are no points. 
- Instead, assignments have **standards** which are descriptions of what constitutes "successful" work. These are given in detail in the document Standards for Student Work in MTH 225, described in more detail below. 
- Rather than grading individual items on assignments (for example individual exam questions), **each assignment** (or, each problem on a Learning Target exam) **is graded as a whole**, and I use the Standards for Student Work document to see if the entire piece of work meets the standard for "success".
- If the item is "successful" according to the standards, it is marked *Success*. Otherwise it is marked either *Retry* or *Incomplete* depending on the assignment. (A mark of *Excellent* is also possible for exams.)
- After I grade your work, in most cases you will receive **detailed feedback** that will tell you whether your work meets the standards, and if not, the feedback will tell you what was missing and how you might go about fixing it. 
- On Exams (both Learning Target and Application/Analysis), you will have the chance to **retry** the exam if needed so you can put the feedback you received to work and improve on the second attempt. 
- Your course grade is not based on point totals or averages (because there are no point values). Instead, the course grade is based on **how many learning tasks you've successfully accomplished** by the end of the semester, using a simple table that's given below. 

Therefore grades in MTH 225 are based not on your ability to do good work at a single point in time, but rather on your ability to **eventually learn the material** by acting on feedback from previous attempts. 

This process, using standards and feedback loops rather than points and averages, is how evaluation of work happens in most situations outside of college. In your future jobs, for example, you'll be reviewed regularly by your manager; it's not a "one and done" situation where you get a point score and then the process is over. Instead, in a real job, you get feedback and coaching on how to improve, and then you act on the feedback and show the boss that you have improved. 

The main drawback of this approach to grading is that it's different and might take getting used to. I've done grading this way for over 10 years now, and I find that most students need no more than a week before they are fully comfortable with this. I encourage you to ask questions at any time so I can help you. 

### The _Standards for Student Work_ document 

The Standards for Student Work in MTH 225 document is a complete one-stop visit for all information about what "success" specifically looks like for each of the assignment types in the course. **It is critically important that you read this document carefully and keep it close at hand**. A link is to it is found in several places in the syllabus, also on the Class Page and on Blackboard; you should also bookmark it in your web browser. 

### How assignments are graded and recorded 

The _Standards for Student Work_ document describes each mark possible for every assignment and what it takes to earn that mark. Here are some more targeted details: 

- **Learning Target Exam problems**: Each problem on a Learning Target exam is graded either *Success* or *Retry* based on whether it meets the standards for success. The exam itself does not receive a grade, only the individual problems. Each problem corresponds to exactly one Learning Target. In the Blackboard gradebook, each Learning Target has a separate entry that will be blank (if the Learning Target has never been attempted on an exam) or will say *Success* or *Retry*. 
- **Application/Analysis exams**: Unlike Learning Target exams, Application/Analysis exams are structured with different sections that contain groups of problems, and you will typically be asked to choose 1-2 items from each group to complete. Then, **the exam is graded as a whole**; individual problems may receive feedback but are not individually graded. The marks possible are *Excellent*, *Success*, and *Retry*; see the Standards for Student Work document for details. Each of the two Application/Analysis exams has a separate Blackboard gradebook entry that will be blank or show one of those three marks. 
- **Class Preps and Application/Analysis assignments**: Both of these are graded on the basis of completeness and effort only, not on correctness. Successful completion earns engagement credits; see below. 

**Engagement credits:** These are awarded for successful completion of a variety of items: 

| Item | Successful completion earns: | 
| --- | -------- | 
| Class attendance (25 minute minimum) | 1 engagement credit | 
| Class prep | 2 engagement credits | 
| Application/Analysis assignment | 4 engagement credits | 

Other one-time items that carry engagement credits will have their values clearly indicated. 



## How your course grade is determined 

### Determining the base grade

Your latter grade is assigned using the table below. It shows the *minimum* requirements for the "base grades" of A, B, C, and D.  Plus/minus modifiers are applied using the rules below the table. 
**To earn a grade in the course, you need to meet or exceed *all* the requirements for that grade.** A grade of "F" is assigned if not all of the requirements for a "D" are met.

| Grade | Learning Targets | Application/Analysis  Exams                               | Engagement credits |
| ----- | :----------------: | :--------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
| A     | 14               | *Excellent* on both                      | 90                 |
| B     | 12               | *Excellent* on one, *Success* on the other | 80                 |
| C     | 10               | *Success* on both                        | 70                 |
| D     | 6                | *Success* on one                         | 35                 |

Additionally, **each student must earn a Success mark on all six Core Learning Targets**. Failing to do so will incur a one-letter grade penalty. 

**The final column assumes a total of 100 engagement credits possible in the course**. If we end up with more than 100 possible engagement credits, the numbers above will stay the same and it will be easier to meet the grade requirements. If it appears we will fall short of that 100 total, the numbers in the last column above will be updated so that they represent 90%, 80%, 70%, and 35% of whatever the total might be. 

**Please note: A grade of "C" or higher is required in MTH 225 for secondary admission into the Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Information Systems, or Information Technology majors.** A grade of C- or lower is insufficient. [Please click here for more details](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/secondary-admission-40.htm). 

### Determining plus/minus modifiers 

**To earn a "plus" on your base grade:** Do one of the following. 

- Earn a *Success* mark on the six Core Learning Targets, twice --- once on a Learning Target exam during the semester, and a second time on the final exam; *or*,
- Satisfy all the requirements for a grade in the table above but go one level higher on either Learning Targets or Application/Analysis exams. 

**To earn a "minus" on your base grade:** Do one of the following. 

- Satisfy all the requirements for a base grade except engagement credits; *or*, 
- Fail to earn a *Success* mark on one or more of the Core Learning Targets on the final exam. 

Earning both a plus and a minus by doing combinations of the above, results in no modification of the base grade (they "cancel out"). Satisfying *both* requirements for any one of the above does not result in any additional modification (for example doing both of the "plus" items does not result in two half-grade increases). 

### Borderline cases 

To earn a grade in the course, you need to meet or exceed *all* the requirements for that grade. **The results from different kinds of assignments do not "average together" or "cancel out".** For example, having 14 Success marks on Learning Targets but only one Successful Application/Analysis exam would result in a base grade of D. **You will need to show consistent competence across the board** since you cannot use one type of assignment to "pull up" another. Instead, typically you will be given the base grade where *all* the requirements are met and a plus or minus modifier. 

If you are close to satisfying the requirements for a grade, but not quite satisfying it, I will consider such borderline cases on a case-by-case basis, using engagement credits as the primary means of deciding. Please note that having only one *Success* on an Application/Analysis exam is not considered "close to" having two of them. 

### The Grade Tracking Checklist 

A **Grade tracking checklist** is provided for you on Blackboard (also linked on the Class Page) to help you stay current with where you stand with your grade. Make sure to keep that checklist up to date each week or more often. You will be asked to show me your updated checklist a few times through the semester for engagement credit, to make sure we are both clear on your progress. 

---

## How to retry your assignments 

A feature of this course is that **you can redo many assignments and exams** to take feedback into account and make improvements to your understanding. Here are the details. 


### Reattempts of Learning Targets

Learning Target exams are cumulative. The plan for coverage of Learning Targets on each is shown below: 

| Learning Target Exam | Date | Learning Targets covered | 
| :--: | :----: | :-----:| 
| 1 | January 27 | 1--4 | 
| 2 | February 17 | 1--8 | 
| 3 | March 10 | 1--12 | 
| 4 | March 31 | 1--15 | 
| (Final exam) | Depends on section | 1--15 | 

If you attempt a problem for a Learning Target and don't earn *Success* on it, **you can try it again at the next exam and on the final exam**. This way, you'll have at least two and up to five different attempts possible on each Learning Target. 

The last two weeks of class are set aside for reassessments as well, and during those times we may have smaller, targeted quizzes on specific Learning Targets, especially the Core Learning Targets. 


### Revision and reattempts of Application/Analysis 

Application/Analysis exams are graded as a whole, with marks of *Excellent*, *Success*, or *Retry*. Two days during the semester are set aside for reattempting Application/Analysis exams: **Friday March 14**, and **Wednesday April 9**. If you are happy with your grades on these exams, you are not required to attend the sessions. But if you want to reattempt an Application/Analysis exam --- to raise your grade from *Retry* to *Success* or from *Success* to *Excellent* --- those are the sessions where this happens. You'll have an additional chance to do so at the final exam, if needed. 

The last two weeks of class are set aside for reassessments as well, and during those times we may, time and meed permitting, schedule another reattempt session. 



### Other assignments 

**Class Prep and Application/Analysis assignments do not have the possibility of reattempts.** These are only graded on the basis of completeness and effort, and you're expected to meet those very minimal requirements the first time. If you don't, then you can make up for the lost engagement credits through other means. 

**Most other engagement credits items are one-time only** and will not have a means of reattempting.
