# MTH 225: Learning Target Exam 1

This exam contains problems on Learning Targets 1--4. Do all your work in the spaces provided. For details on how these are graded, please see the [Standards for Student Work Document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2025/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20MTH%20225%20W25.md). Note that in the Standards, unless a problem or part of a problem asks you to "state" something, you must provide work with your answer that completely justifies your answer. You may use a standard calculator but no other technology. 

## Learning Target 1

> (**CORE**) Given two integers $a$ and $b$, I can find the quotient and remainder when dividing $a$ by $b$, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ using the Euclidean Algorithm, and the value of `a % b`.

1. Use long division to find the quotient and remainder obtained when dividing $78294$ by $22$.

2. Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find $\gcd(250, 8)$. 

3. State the values of each of the following: 

- (a) $1234 \, \% \, 56$ 

- (b) $123098091235 \, \% \, 2$

- (c) $7890 \, \% \, 3$

## Learning Target 4

>(**CORE**) I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, and negation.

Consider the implication: **Classes will be cancelled if the roads are bad.** 

1. State the hypothesis and conclusion of this implication. Make sure to state which is which. 
2. State the converse. 
3. State the contrapositive. 
4. State the negation.
