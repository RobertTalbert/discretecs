# MTH 225: Practice Learning Target Exam

This is a practice run on problems similar to what you will see on Learning Target Exams throughout the semester. Your first official Learning Target Exam is on **Monday, January 27** and will contain problems on Learning Targets 1--4. This practice version also contains problems for Learning Targets 1--4 although you are not expected to complete Learning Target 4, since we have not discussed it yet. It's only there for study and reference. Try it, if you know what the words mean. 

Do all your work in the spaces provided. For details on how these are graded, please see the [Standards for Student Work Document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2025/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20MTH%20225%20W25.md). You may use a standard calculator but no other technology. 

## Learning Target 1

> (**CORE**) Given two integers $a$ and $b$, I can find the quotient and remainder when dividing $a$ by $b$, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ using the Euclidean Algorithm, and the value of `a % b`.

1. Use long division to find the quotient and remainder obtained when dividing $75309$ by $86$.

2. Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find $\gcd(96, 729)$. 

3. State the values of each of the following: 

- (a) $227 \, \\% \, 3$ 

- (b) $190823120 \, \\% \, 2$

- (c) $5551 \, \\% \, 5$

## Learning Target 2

>I can convert a positive integer between bases 2, 8, 10, and 16; and I can represent a negative integer in binary using twos complement.

1. Convert the integer `101101` from binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10). 
2. Convert the integer $771$ from octal (base 8) to decimal (base 10). 
3. Convert the integer 867 from decimal (base 10) to hexadecimal (base 16).

## Learning Target 3

> I can perform arithmetic operations on binary numbers. 

1. Compute `1011011 + 10101`.
2. Compute `10101 - 111`. 
3. Compute `11001` $\times$ `101`. 
4. Compute `1100111` $\div$ `101`.

## Learning Target 4

>(**CORE**) I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, and negation.

Consider the implication: **If the ground is wet, then it's raining.** 

1. State the hypothesis and conclusion of this implication. Make sure to state which is which. 
2. State the converse. 
3. State the contrapositive. 
4. State the negation.
