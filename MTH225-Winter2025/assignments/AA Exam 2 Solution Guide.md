## Multiple Choice Answers

1. **A**: Not injective, because for example $f(12) = 2$ and $f(22) = 2$. Also not surjective because the only outputs are $0, 1, 2, 3, \dots, 9$. 
2. **D**: The cardinality of the set itself is 10, and so the cardinality of the power set is $2^{10} = 1024$.
3. **B**: $A \times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. There are 10 ways to choose $a$ and 3 ways to choose $b$, so there are $10 \times 3 = 30$ ordered pairs.
4. **D**: If the two sets were completely disjoint, we would just add the two cardinalities together to get the size of the union ($10 + 14 = 24$). But there may be points in common, so we have to subtract the size of the intersection. We don't know what that size is, but subtracting it off would give something at most 24. 
5. **E**: The first two responses are standard interpretations of the binomial coefficient. (We usually say we are counting bitstrings with a certain number of `1` bits, but this is equivalent to counting the number of `0` bits.) Response (C) is incorrect because the binomial coefficient does not take order into account. 
6. **B**: This is a standard fact about the binomial coefficient. 
7. **B**: Treat the problem as a license plate situation. 
8. **A**: Again think about license plates -- there are $k$ blanks and $n$ choices per blank. 
9.  **B**: This is a standard fact about the factorial function. 
10. **B**: This is standard set terminology.
