# Answer key for Learning Target Exam 1

Please note: This key does not give work or explanations for all of these problems. Some have explanations or notes where it might be helpful for you. Otherwise, especially for calculations, the work is not shown, although this work should appear in complete and 


his key *does not* show the work that is required for some of the problems on the exam --- only the answers. Remember that unless the problem says otherwise or if it asks you to "state" something, your answer must be accompanied with work or an explanation that justifies the answer. For questions about that work or explanation, please bring those to drop-in hours, an [appointment](http://calendly.com/robert-talbert), or email. 

## Learning Target 1

1. Use long division to find the quotient and remainder obtained when dividing $78294$ by $22$.

**Answer**: Quotient = 3558, Remainder = 22. Note: Work is not shown on this one due to math formatting limitations. For questions about your work, please bring those to drop-in hours, an [appointment](http://calendly.com/robert-talbert), or email. 



2. Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find $\gcd(250, 8)$. 

**Solution**: 

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
250 &= 8(31) + 2 \\
8 &= 2(4) + 0
\end{eqnarray*}$$

The remainder is zero, so the algorithm halts and the GCD is the last nonzero remainder: $\gcd(250,8) = 2$. 


**Answer**: 2

3. State the values of each of the following: 

- (a) $1234 \, \% \, 56$ 
- (b) $123098091235 \, \% \, 2$
- (c) $7890 \, \% \, 3$

**Answers**: 2, 1, 0. (Note, no work needs to be shown here because it asks you to "state" the values.) 




## Learning Target 2

>I can convert a positive integer between bases 2, 8, 10, and 16; and I can represent a negative integer in binary using twos complement.

1. Convert the integer $42B$ from hexadecimal (base 16) to decimal (base 10). 

**Solution**: 
$$(42B)_{16} = 4 \times 16^2 + 2 \times 16^1 + 11 \times 16^0 = 1067$$


2. Convert the integer `11101111` from binary (base 2) to decimal (base 10). 

**Solution:** 
$$(11101111)_2 = 1 \times 2^7 + 1 \times 2^6 + 1 \times 2^5 + 0 \times 2^4 + 1 \times 2^3 1 \times 2^2 1 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 = 239$$

3. Convert the integer 445 from decimal (base 10) to binary (base 2). 

**Solution**: Using the base conversion algorithm: 

$$\begin{eqnarray*}
445 &= 2(222) + 1 \\
222 &= 2(111) + 0 \\
111 &= 2(55) + 1 \\ 
55 &= 2(27) + 1 \\
27 &= 2(13) + 1 \\
13 &= 2(6) + 1 \\
6 &= 2(3) + 0 \\
3 &= 2(1) + 1 \\
1 &= 2(0) + 1
\end{eqnarray*}$$

The algorithm halts here since the quotient is $0$ and we read the remainders off in reverse order: `110111101`. 


## Learning Target 3

Note: Work is not shown below due to math formatting limitations. For questions about your work, please bring those to drop-in hours, an [appointment](http://calendly.com/robert-talbert), or email. 

1. Compute `101111 + 101011`.
2. Compute `10101 - 10011`. 
3. Compute `11001` $\times$ `110`. 
4. Compute `1100111` $\div$ `11`. 

**Answers**: `1011010`; `10`; `10010110`; Quotient = `100010`, Remainder = `1`. 


## Learning Target 4

Consider the implication: **Classes will be cancelled if the roads are bad.** 

1. State the hypothesis and conclusion of this implication. Make sure to state which is which. 
2. State the converse. 
3. State the contrapositive. 
4. State the negation. 

**Answers**: 
1. Hypothesis: The roads are bad. Conclusion: Classes will be cancelled. 
2. If classes are cancelled, the roads are bad. 
3. If classes are not cancelled, the roads are not bad. 
4. The roads are bad, but class isn't cancelled. 

Note: There is no "work" to show because it asks you to "state" the answers. For questions about your work, please bring those to drop-in hours, an [appointment](http://calendly.com/robert-talbert), or email.
