# Answer key for Learning Target Exam 1

Please note: This key does not give work or explanations for all of these problems. Some have explanations or notes where it might be helpful for you. Otherwise, especially for calculations, the work is not shown, although this work should appear in complete and 


his key *does not* show the work that is required for some of the problems on the exam --- only the answers. Remember that unless the problem says otherwise or if it asks you to "state" something, your answer must be accompanied with work or an explanation that justifies the answer. For questions about that work or explanation, please bring those to drop-in hours, an [appointment](http://calendly.com/robert-talbert), or email.
