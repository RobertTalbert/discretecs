# Application/Analysis Homework 9

## Instructions

Please **work all problems on your own paper, note-taking app, on a whiteboard, or typed**. Whatever format you use, submit a **single, black-and-white PDF of your work** by creating this PDF and uploading it to the folder on Blackboard labeled **Application/Analysis Homework 9**. If you handwrite your work on paper or a whiteboard, **scan** it to a black-and-white PDF and upload the PDF. **Do not just take a picture with your phone -- scan it, using a scanning app** so that the result is a PDF, not an image. You practiced this process in the Startup Activity, and there is a tutorial in the START HERE area about how to do it. 

Application/Analysis Homework sets are graded on the basis of **completion and effort only** and you will earn 4 engagement credits for earning a *Success* mark. The standards for earning that mark are given in the [Standards for Student Work](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2025/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20MTH%20225%20W25.md) document. Make sure to review those standards before you turn in your work.

There are no practice exercises this time, since the WeBWorK sets give you ample practice. 

 
## Multiple choice

The following multiple choice items are REQUIRED, that is NOT OPTIONAL. For each, give the letter for the response you believe is most correct. Explanations are not required; but if you give one and there's an issue with your reasoning, I'll give you feedback. 

1. The notation $P(10,4)$ refers to the number of
    - (a) Ways to select 4 items from a set of 10 items
    - (b) Ways to select 10 items from a set of 4 items
    - (c) Ways to make an ordered selection of 4 items from a set of 10 items
    - (d) Ways to make an ordered selection of 10 items from a set of 4 items
    - (e) None of these 

2. The number of ways to rearrange the letters in the word "MISSISSIPPI" is
    - (a) $11!$
    - (b) $11!/(4!4!2!)$
    - (c) $11!/(4!4!2!2!)$
    - (d) $11!/(4!4!2!2!)$
    - (e) None of these
  
3. The number of ways select $k$ items from a set of $n$ items where repetition is allowed, is given by
    - (a) $n^k$
    - (b) $n!/(n-k)!$
    - (c) $\binom{n}{k}$
    - (d) $n!/k!$
    - (e) None of these

4. How many ways can you select 3 people from a group of 5 people for a committee?
    - (a) $5 \times 4 \times 3$  
    - (b) $5!/(3!2!)$
    - (c) $5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$
    - (d) $3!/2!$
    - (e) None of these

5. The number of ways to arrange 4 different books on a shelf is 
    - (a) $\binom{4}{2}$
    - (b) $4!$
    - (c) $P(4,4)$
    - (d) $4 \times 3 \times 2$
    - (e) None of these

## Problems to solve 

**Note on these problems:** All of these are "mixed" counting problems, meaning they involve a mix of permutations, combinations, and/or the multiplication principle. **Do not merely give an answer, or just the setup for a calculation followed by an answer, but a complete explanation for your approach to each solution, in clear English written in complete sentences.** Any solution that is not accompanied by a clear, complete, and correct explanation in English will result in the assignment being marked "Incomplete". Also, do not solve these problems by "brute force", that is, by making a list of all the objects you're counting and then finding the length of the list. Use the counting techniques we've learned in this course instead. (However, it's not a bad idea to check your answer using brute force.)



1. Think about making strings using only the letters a, b, and c, for example `bbaabcaaaa`. How many strings of length 10 can be made using these letters, that have exactly 3 a's or exactly 4 b's? 

2. How many positive integers less than 1000...
    - (a) Have exactly one 3 in them?
    - (b) Have at least one 9 in them? 
    - (c) Have two consecutive digits equal to 5? 


3. How many subsets of a set with ten elements 
   - (a) Have fewer than five elements? 
   - (b) Have an even number of elements?
   - (c) Have more than seven elements?
