# Learning Target reassessment


## Instructions

**NEW RULES regarding Learning Targets you have already mastered:**

1. You may not attempt any Learning Target on which you already have a rating of *Master*.
2. If you do reattempt a Learning Target on which you have a rating of *Master*, you will receive a 10 point deduction from your engagement credit total for each Learning Target you attempt on which you already have a rating of *Master*.
3. Also, if you reattempt a Learning Target on which you have a rating of *Master*, you will receive whatever rating you earn on that Learning Target, even if it is lower than *Master*.

These rules are in place for all Learning Target reattempts from now on, including the final exam and mini-exams. 

Additionally on this exam: 

- Put no more than one Learning Target on a single page, including the back of that page. One Learning Target per piece of paper you are handing in. 
- Put your name at the top of each page you submit. 
- As always: **You must show your work and explain your reasoning clearly and in complete sentences in order to earn a rating of *Master* unless the problem clearly says otherwise** -- for example if it asks you merely to "State" something.

## Learning Target 1

>(**CORE**) Given two integers $a$ and $b$, I can find the quotient and remainder when dividing $a$ by $b$, the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ using the Euclidean Algorithm, and the value of `a % b`.

1. Use long division to find the quotient and remainder when dividing 8935 by 15.
2. Use the Euclidean Algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of 8935 and 15.
3. Find the value of the following: 
   - a. `2341234230 % 10`.
   - b. `8935 % 15`.
   - c. `8935 % 8935`.


## Learning Target 4

>(**CORE**) I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and state its converse, contrapositive, and negation.

Consider the implication: *If I drive to Detroit, then I will arrive at the concert on time.*

1. State the hypothesis and conclusion of the implication.
2. State the converse of the implication.
3. State the contrapositive of the implication.
4. State the negation of the implication.


## Learning Target 9

>(**CORE**) Given a statement to prove by mathematical induction, I can set up the framework for its proof.

Consider the statement: *For all positive integers $n \geq 5$, $n^2 < 2^n$. Suppose we want to prove this statement by induction.

1. State the predicate involved in the proposition.
2. State the value of the variable that corresponds to the base case. 
3. Prove that the base case holds. 
4. State the inductive hypothesis. 
5. State the inductive step (what you would need to prove to complete the argument). Note, you do not need to provide a completed proof here. 


## Learning Target 10

>Given a set in roster notation, I can rewrite it in set-builder notation and vice versa, and I can determine its elements and subsets.


1. Here are three sets written in set-builder notation. For each, if the set is written using correct set syntax, rewrite it using roster notation. If the set is written using incorrect syntax, write **INCORRECT SYNTAX**. 

    - (a) $\lbrace x \in \lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots \rbrace | x^2 -1 = 0\rbrace$
    - (b) $\lbrace x^2 + 1 | x \in \mathbb{Z} \rbrace$
    - (c) $\lbrace x \in \mathbb{Z} | x^2  \rbrace$

2. Below are several statements about sets and elements. Label each one as **TRUE** or **FALSE**. 

    - (a) $0 \in \emptyset$ 
    - (b) $\{1,2,3\} \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}$
    - (c) $0 \in \mathbb{Z}$
    - (d) $\mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{N}$
    - (e) $\emptyset \subseteq \{1,2,3,4,5\}$


## Learning Target 11


>(**CORE**) I can find the union, intersection, Cartesian product, and difference of two sets; the complement of a set; and the cardinality of a finite set.

**Note**: We usually indicate the complement of a set $A$ by putting a bar over the $A$. However this notation doesn't render well online or in some of the publishing tools I am using. Therefore we will use $A^c$ to indicate the complement of $A$ from here on out. 

Consider the sets $A = \lbrace 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \rbrace$,  $B = \lbrace 4, 5, 6 \rbrace$, $C = \lbrace  6,7,8 \rbrace$ and the universal set $U = \lbrace 0, 1, 2, \dots, 10  \rbrace$.


1. State $C \cap A$.
2. State $A \cup B$.
3. State $A \times C$.
4. State $C \setminus A$.
5. State $B^c$.
6. State $|A|$.



## Learning Target 13

>(**CORE**) I can solve simple counting problems that involve a combination of the Additive Rule, Multiplicative Rule, and Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion.

Solve the following counting problems. Be sure to show all work, and explain your reasoning. Responses that consist only of answers, even if correct, will not be rated as *Master*. Responses that are illegible or very difficult to follow will also not be rated as *Master*. 


1. Think about 10-character strings where the only letters used are `x` and `y`. For example, `xxyyxyyyyx`. How many of these strings are possible, that either start with an `x` or end with a `y`?
2. An ice cream store offers 5 flavors of ice cream. How many different sundaes can be made with 2 scoops of ice cream if the order of the scoops does not matter?
3. Standard automobile license plates in a country display 2 numbers, followed by 2 letters, followed by 3 numbers. How many different standard plates are possible in this system? (Assume repetition of letters and numbers is allowed.)

##  Learning Target 14 

>(CORE) I can compute a binomial coefficient and solve simple counting problems that involve combinations, permutations, or k-permutations.

On the following, be sure to show all work, and explain your reasoning. Responses that consist only of answers, even if correct, will not be rated as *Master*. Responses that are illegible or very difficult to follow will also not be rated as *Master*. 

1. Compute the following. 
   - a. $\binom{11}{9}$
   - b. $\binom{25}{20}$
   - c. $\binom{1000}{1}$
2. Think about 10-character strings where the only letters used are `x` and `y`. For example, `xxyyxyyyyx`. How many of these strings are possible that contain exactly 4 `x`'s? 
3. A committee of 3 people is to be chosen from a group of 12 people. How many different committees are possible if the order in which the committee members are chosen does not matter?


## Learning Target 15

>I can determine if a sequence is arithmetic or geometric; and I can state closed-form and recursive formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences.

**PLEASE NOTE: The instructions on this one have changed from Learning Target Exam 4.** 

Below are four integer sequences. For each one, determine if it is arithmetic, geometric, or neither and clearly state "arithmetic", "geometric", or "neither". Then, if a sequence is either arithmetic or geometric, **give both a closed formula and a complete recursive definition for the sequence**. Please note, *both* kinds of formulas are required for *each* sequence that you label as arithmetic or geometric. No further explanation is needed if you decide a sequence should be labeled as "neither".

**You are to assume that all starting indexes are 0, not 1**. You do not need to show your work, but your answers must conform to the Standards for Student Work Document.


1. $2, 6, 18, 54, \dots$
2. $3, 3, 7, 6, 4, \dots$
3. $10, 12, 14, 16, \dots$
4. $-1, 1, -1, 1,-1, 1, \dots$
