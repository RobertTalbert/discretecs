# How to make your own practice exercises 

## Use the standard sources first: 

* [Your textbook](https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi4.html): Find the relevant section for the item you need to practice and use the interactive exercises found there. 
* Practice exercises from [Application/Analysis Homework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pCxYpwLsHa9ciZv4zrtCH2P3aEM6g6Za2onQsOJCung/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.6eprh0moo8kg)
* [WeBWorK](https://webwork-math.gvsu.edu/webwork2/) sets 
* Past Learning Target Exams 

Also review the [Standards for Student Work document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2025/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20MTH%20225%20W25.md), especially [this section](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2025/course-docs/Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20MTH%20225%20W25.md#standards-for-learning-targets) which details what you will be asked to do on each Learning Target and what constitutes "Success" on each. 

A lot of these practice activities involve "generating a positive integer" or pair of integers. You can do this yourself, or [use a random number generator](https://www.random.org/integers/). 


## Learning Target 1 

Generate two positive integers $a$ and $b$. Then: 

- Do long division to find the quotient and remainder. [Check work with this calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/longdivision.php). 
- Run the Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD. [Check work with this calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/math/gcf-euclids-algorithm.php). 

Then generate several pairs of integers $a$ and $b$ and compute `a % b`. Check your work with Python or some other calculator. 

## Learning Target 2

Generate a positive integer in base 10. Then convert it to bases 2, 8, and 16 using the base conversion algorithm by hand. [Check your work here](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/base-converter.html). 

To go the other direction, take your results from the first step and convert them back to base 10. You should get the number you started with. Or, generate a random integer and use the calculator linked above to convert it to base 2, 8, or 16 and then convert that number back to base 10. 

## Learning Target 3 

Generate several binary (base 2) integers. For addition, the integers should be 6-10 bits. For multplication and division, one of them should be 6-8 bits and the other 2-3 bits. Then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. [Check your work here](https://www.calculator.net/binary-calculator.html). 

## Learning Target 4 

Make up a conditional statement in English: *If* (condition), *then* (conclusion). Then write the converse, contrapositive, and negation of the statement. Use an AI tool to check your work: Prompt the AI with the original statement and ask it to provide the converse, contrapositive, and negation.

## Learning Target 5 

Make up, or look up, a logical proposition in symbolic form, using either two variables or three. Then write the truth table by hand. [Then check your work here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/). Remember to show all the intermediate columns, which this tool does not do.
