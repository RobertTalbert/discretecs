## Activities 

- Preclass activities using Desmos, ClassKick 
- Part 1 activities: 
  - Active work, posted online for asynchronous work and done by Tuesday night
  - F2F: Polling, Q&A -- mainly this is student-driven 
- Similarly for part 2 
- But modules aren't structured with A/B parts like calculus -- just one big module 
- "Friday" activities: 
  - Polling to review main concepts 
  - Questions from throughout the week  

Recurring activities -- these are also assessments: 

- Guided Practice to start modules
- Asynchronous activities following M and W classes (do similar stuff in class, but the activities themselves are like little HW sets)
- LT assessments like 201
- AEP's like 201 
- EC's for...
  - Guided Practice
  - Completing active learning tasks from MW 
  - Weekly check-ins
  - Making videos of the asynchronous activities 
  - CodeAcademy Python 
  - Startup  
  - Misc

- Python via Google Colab for Python 
- Google Jamboard or MS Whiteboard for whiteboarding needs
