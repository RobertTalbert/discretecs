MTH 325: Discrete Structures for CS 2 -- Learning Modules 
=========================================================

# List of modules 

## General modules

+ Getting Started: Answer questions about the syllabus; read and respond to articles about flipped classroom and specs grading; read and respond to article about use of math in computing; lay out their goals and questions for the semester (including initial thoughts on what grade they want)
+ Technological Competency: Demonstrate successful setup of Piazza, Learning Catalytics, and SageMath Cloud accounts; demonstrate successful setup of local installation of Sage; demonstrate use of Piazza and sharing files and projects in SMC; demonstrate proficiency in doing basic Sage calculations and putting it into a formatted Sage notebook 

## Content modules 

Each of these modules has three levels. Level 1 consists of basic mechanical computations, simple applications, and conceptual reasoning. Level 2 consists of more advanced work involving application and analysis. Level 3 is the highest level of work and includes programming and/or proof activities. See the master learning outcomes list for mid- and low-level learning outcomes for each module. 

+ Relations 1: Representation and Properties
+ Relations 2: Closures
+ Relations 3: Equivalence Relations and Partially Ordered Sets

+ Graphs 1: Representation and Properties
+ Graphs 2: Connectivity, Paths, and Circuits
+ Graphs 3: Shortest paths, Planarity, and Coloring

+ Trees 1: Properties 
+ Trees 2: Applications
+ Trees 3: Spanning Trees
