    "__Summary:__ This lesson is a review of _proof by mathematical induction_, a technique for proving that a mathematical proposition that involves recursion, is always true. We discuss the idea of a _predicate_, the _induction hypothesis_ and _induction step_ in a mathematical induction proof, and two variations on the basic induction technique called _strong induction_ and _structural induction_. \n",

    "Consider the following sequence of integers: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, \\dots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This sequence is known as the the _Fibonacci sequence_ (due to its inventor, who [came up with the idea when modeling the breeding of rabbits](http://science.jrank.org/pages/2705/Fibonacci-Sequence-History.html)). The Fibonacci sequence has a distinctive pattern: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ The first two sequence terms, let's call them $F_1$ and $F_2$, are both equal to $1$. \n",
    "+ Each of the third and subsequent sequence terms ($F_3, F_4, F_5, \\dots$) are equal to the sum of the previous two terms. For example $F_3$ is equal to $F_1 + F_2$; $F_4 = F_3 + F_2$; and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a _recurrence relation_ we can write a _recursive definition_ of the Fibonacci sequence like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \\ (\\text{for} \\ n \\geq 3) \\qquad F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fibonacci sequence is inherently recursive because __each part (except the beginning) is built out of previously-computed parts__. Here is some Python code that finds $F_n$ for any positive integer $n$, using recursion: "

    "The Fibonacci numbers have a lot of really interesting properties and patterns. In fact [there is an entire scholarly journal](http://www.fq.math.ca/) devoted solely to the study of the Fibonacci numbers! \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose that I wanted to give you a quick oral exam to see whether you could _prove_ to me that you really understood how the Fibonacci sequence works. Your grade on this exam is dependent on whether you can convince me, beyond all doubt, that you know how to generate the elements of this sequence. And suppose I am really skeptical and hard to convince. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way that _wouldn't_ work is if you just recited the first few numbers in the sequence -- that is, you just said that the Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 \"and so on\". This doesn't  prove, conclusively, that you understand the Fibonacci numbers because _anybody_ could just memorize the first five elements of the sequence. This doesn't show me that you understand the essence of how this sequence is constructed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that wouldn't work is if you recited a _longer_ list of numbers in the sequence -- that is, if you said that the Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 \"and so on\". While this is harder to do than reciting the first five numbers in the sequence, it's still just memorization, and anybody with good memory could do it without having a clue of how the Fibonacci sequence works. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, _no amount of examples is enough_ to prove to me that you understand the sequence if all you are doing is giving examples. Because, how do I know that you understand the math, and not just that you have an excellent memory? \n",
    "\n",
    "A third way that wouldn't work would be for you to list _all_ the Fibonacci numbers. This won't work because there are infinitely many of them, and we'd both be dead before you really even got started. \n",
    "\n",
    "What _would_ demonstrate sufficient evidence that you understand the Fibonacci numbers? Well, what would have to happen is that you would __explain how ANY Fibonacci number regardless of its location in the sequence is built__. That is, proof that you understand the Fibonacci sequence would require not a demonstration of examples but an _explanation of why_ the examples are what they are, or perhaps you could _show me how_ to find any Fibonacci number. (Now this sounds like MTH 325, where the primary emphases are on _explaining why_ and _showing how_.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how I, as an instructor, might structure this hypothetical exam, that would convince me utterly that you know how to generate this sequence. It would go in two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, I'd ask you to give me a list of the first three Fibonacci numbers. This would show me that you know how the sequence begins. \n",
    "2. Then, I'd pick a random positive integer, let's call it $k$, and give you a list of the first $k$ Fibonacci numbers; and then I'd ask you to explain how to get the _next_ one (that is, the $(k+1)$-st one). \n",
    "\n",
    "Why would this convince me, the ultimate skeptic? Well, the first part would show me that you know how to _begin_ listing the Fibonacci numbers --- how to start the listing process. And the second part, where the real meat of this argument resides, would show me that you're not just memorizing because it would show me that you could start _anywhere_ in the sequence and go from the previously-computed sequence to the _next element_. Putting those two parts together, I know you could list from memory the numbers $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$; then using the second part I know you could compute $F_4$. Then using the second part I know you could compute $F_5$. Then using the second part I know you could compute $F_6$. And so on. You don't have to _actually list_ those numbers; you've _shown how to make the list_ from an arbitrary starting point, and that amounts to the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore given enough time, you could build any Fibonacci number in the list, and it doesn't depend on memorizing. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why induction is important for computer scientists \n",
    "\n",
    "The above example is typical of how you, as a computer scientist, will need to _reason about computing_ both now and in the future. For example, you will be called upon in your career to write code or design algorithms that claim to accomplish a certain task -- say, for example, quickly searching a database to find a record. You can write the code, and it may _appear_ to work based on a few examples that you run, but to make this code really workable in the real world there are tough questions you have to answer such as \n",
    "\n",
    "+ How do you know that your program _always_ produces the correct output _any time_ the correct input is put in? \n",
    "+ How do you know that your program _always_ terminates? \n",
    "+ How do you know that your program _always_ runs efficiently? \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like how merely reciting a list of Fibonacci numbers does not mean that you understand the Fibonacci numbers, merely producing a list of correct outputs -- even a maassive one -- does not prove that your program _always_ works. How do we know that the _next_ example, the one you _didn't_ try, doesn't crash the program? Something more is needed in order to make that knowledge certain. That \"something\" is a __proof__, which was the subject of [the lesson for Learning Target P.1](https://goo.gl/YAlpsO). \n",
    "\n",
    "Proofs that pertain to _recursive structures_ like the Fibonacci numbers --- in which the structure is built out of previously-computed or \"smaller\" versions of that structure --- have a special place in computer science, and almost always they involve the concept of __proof by mathematical induction__. Keep in mind: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Mathematical induction is typically used to prove things about recursive structures.__\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into mathematical induction, we need to review one piece of logic that plays a central role. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [lesson for Learning Target P.1](https://goo.gl/YAlpsO) we reviewed the idea of a _proposition_:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Definition: A __proposition__ is a complete, well-formed sentence that has a definite truth value of _True_ or _False_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all logical expressions we choose to work with are propositions exactly. For example, consider this sentence: \n",
    "\n",
    ">The number $n$ is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a proposition because although it's a well-formed complete sentence, it does not have a definite truth value. Is $n$ even? We don't know, because we don't know what $n$ is. In fact this sentence is true for _some_ values of $n$ but false for others. The truth value depends on the value of $n$. The sentence contains a __variable__ ($n$) and since we lack information about that variable, we cannot conclude that the statement is true or that it's false. We say that the variable is _unquantified_. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we _quantified_ the variable --- that is, we gave complete information about the value or values of $n$ --- then we _could_ determine whether that statement above is true. Here's an example of where we quantify the variable:\n",
    "\n",
    ">If $n = 25$, the number $n$ is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we've specified the scope of the values of $n$ --- we've \"quantified\" the variable. (In fact we are really just plugging in a single value for it.) The resulting statement is definitely false! The fact that we can say so, means that the quantified statement is now really a proposition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another example of quantifying the variable: \n",
    "\n",
    ">If $n = F_{21}$ (the 21st Fibonacci number), then $n$ is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "This also completely specifies the scope of the variable. Is the statement now true or false? We'll we'd need to go figure out what $F_{21}$ equals. A [quick check](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html) says that $F_{21} = 10946$. That's even, so the statement in this case is true. Because we could state its truth value, it means the statement is a proposition now. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the original statement is true for some $n$'s and false for others. That means the statement \"The number $n$ is even\", is sort of like a _function_: We plug in a value of $n$, and we get a _Boolean_ as the output --- either `True` or `False`. We could actually write code for this: "

    "+ __The number $n!$ is greater than $2^n$.__ The variable here is $n$. This statement is true for some values of $n$ (example: $n = 5$, because $5! = 120$ and $2^5 = 32$) but not true for other values of $n$ (example: $n = 3$, because $3! = 6$ and $2^3 = 8$). \n",

It's also true for other examples, like $n = 6$ (look at $F_{18}$) and $n=7$ (look at $F_{21}$). \n",

    "\n",
    "Of course this is just a list of eight examples, and so it's not definitive, but it certainly does suggest that $F_{3n}$ is even _every time_ $n$ is a positive integer. \n",

By quantifying the variable over a range of values (in this case, \"all positive integers\") we are transforming a predicate --- which does not have a definite truth value --- into a _proposition_ which _does_ have a definite truth value. So we can quantify variables in a predicate not only by plugging in specific numbers but also by specifying a range of variable values over which we think the predicate is true. \n",

    "## Two variations on mathematical induction\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the examples you saw above involve propositions that are claimed to be true over some subset of the natural numbers. But sometimes we encounter propositions that seem amenable to induction but involve different sets. There are two variations on the basic induction theme that address these situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strong Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of an induction proof went like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Base case:__ Show that the predicate is true in the smallest possible case. \n",
    "2. __Induction hypothesis:__ Assume that the predicate is true for some arbitrary positive integer, say $k$. \n",
    "3. __Inductive step:__ Having assumed the induction hypothesis, prove that the predicate is true for the _next_ positive integer, that is $k+1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes Step 3 can be an issue because it involves going from an arbitrary step to __the next step__ (from $k$ to $k+1$), and this sometimes gets us into trouble. For example consider this proposition: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proposition:__ For all positive integers $n \\geq 2$, the number $n$ can be written as the product of one or more prime numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a _prime number_ is an integer whose factorization is only $1$ and itself, like $7$ or $23$; on the other hand numbers like $8$ and $24$ are not prime because they can factor into other products ($8 = 2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ and $24 = 8 \\times 3$.) \n",
    "\n",
    "Everybody \"knows\" that positive integers can be factored into a product of prime numbers. For example $1998 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 37$. You learn this in elementary school, but you've probably never _proved_ it. We can actually prove this with induction, but we have to do things a little differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "First let's set up the framework. The predicate $P(n)$ in this case is the statement \"the number $n$ can be written as the product of one or more prime numbers\". We believe this predicate is true for all positive integers $n$. The framework would look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. (_Base case_) Show that the number $2$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. \n",
    "2. (_Inductive hypothesis_) Assume that for some positive integer $k \\geq 2$, that $k$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. \n",
    "3. (_Inductive step_) Prove that $k+1$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The base case is easy because $2$ is a prime number itself, and therefore a \"product\" of prime numbers. Where we run into difficult here is going from the inductive hypothesis to the inductive step. If we assume $k$ can be factored into a product of primes, how on Earth are to conclude anything about the factorization of $k+1$? __There is no natural connection between the prime factorization of $k$ and $k+1$.__ To see this better, look at a few examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "| k | Factorization of $k$ | Factorization of $k+1$ | \n",
    "|:--: | :---- | :------- | \n",
    "| 3 | $3$ (prime) | $2 \\times 2$ | \n",
    "| 10 | $2 \\ times 5$ | $11$ (prime) | \n",
    "| 2000 | $2^4 \\times 5^3$ |  $5 \\times 23 \\times 29$ | \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, __there's no obvious connection between the truth of $P(k)$ and the truth of $P(k+1)$.__ So induction seems not to fit. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variation we introduce here is the following change to the framework, and the change happens in the induction hypothesis: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. (_Base case_) Show that the number $2$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. \n",
    "2. (_New Inductive hypothesis_) Assume that for some positive integer $k \\geq 2$, __every integer $2, 3, 4, \\dots, k$__ can be written as a product of prime numbers. \n",
    "3. (_Inductive step_) Prove that $k+1$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do you see the difference? Instead of assuming that the predicate $P(n)$ is true for _just one_ integer $k$, we are assuming that $P(n)$ is true _for all values less than or equal to $k$_. We assume the truth of the predicate for a _range_ of values ending at $k$, not just for the single value $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This form of induction has a name: \n",
    "\n",
    ">Definition: __Strong induction__ is a method of proof which shares the same framework as mathematical induction except in the inductive hypothesis, we assume that the predicate is true for all values of the variable less than or equal to an arbitrary value $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, the mathematical induction we learned above is sometimes called \"weak induction\" to distinguish it from strong induction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We gave the framework for a proof by strong induction earlier for our proposition about prime factorizations. Here is a completed proof. Can you spot where strong induction was used? \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proof:__ For the base case, we need to show that $2$ is a product of prime numbers. Since $2$ is itself prime, it is therefore a product of primes. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Now assume that for some integer $k \\geq 2$, every integer $2,3,4,\\dots,k$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. We need to show that $k+1$ can be written as a product of prime numbers. We proceed by considering two possible cases that cover all possibilities: Either $k+1$ is prime itself, or it isn't prime. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Case 1: If $k+1$ is prime itself, then it is a product of primes, and we're done. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Case 2: If $k+1$ is not prime itself, then it can be factored into a product of two integers (which are not necessarily prime), say $k+1 = ab$ with $a,b > 1$. Now, both $a$ and $b$ have to be less than $k+1$ because they both divide $k+1$ and are bigger than 1. This means that both $a$ and $b$ are less than or equal to $k$. The induction hypothesis now states that both $a$ and $b$ are a product of prime numbers, say $a = p_1p_2p_3\\cdots p_i$ and $b = q_1q_2q_3\\cdots q_j$. Therefore $ab$ is a product of prime numbers, $ab = p_1p_2p_3\\cdots p_i \\cdot q_1q_2q_3\\cdots q_j$, and that's what we wanted to show. \n",
    "\n",
    "By using strong induction, we didn't need to start at $k+1$ and go back _just one step_ to $k$. We could go back as many steps as we needed and use the induction hypothesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structural Induction\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet another form of induction is useful when the thing we are working with is _something other than numbers_, like a set or a graph or a tree that has a recursive flavor but is not numerical. Here is an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the set $S$ that is defined recursively as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Basis step:__ The set $S$ contains the strings `a` and `b`.\n",
    "+ __Recursion rule:__ If $\\lambda$ is a string in $S$, then $a + \\lambda + b$ is also in the set (where `+` means concatenation of strings). \n",
    "\n",
    "So we are given that `a` and `b` belong to $S$. By the recursion rule this also means that the following strings are in $S$: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ `aab`, because I can take `a` (which is in $S$ by the basis step) and concatenate `a` on the left and `b` on the right. \n",
    "+ `abb`, because I can take `b` (which is also in $S$ by the basis step) and concatenate `a` on the left and `b` on the right.. \n",
    "+ `aaabb` because I can take `aab` from earlier and concatenate `a` on the left and `b` on the right. \n",
    "+ `aabba` for the same reason except I use `abb` from the second point above. \n",
    "+ Also the strings `aaaabbb`, `aaabbab`, `aaaaabbbb`, `aaaabbabb`, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "This set is apparently infinite and note that it has absolutely nothing to do with integers. Here's something that appears to be true about this recursively-defined set: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Conjecture:__ For each string $x \\in S$, the length of $x$ is odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is a conjecture about a recursively defined structure, an appropriate proof technique would seem to be induction. It's even simple to identify the predicate: __\"The length of $x$ is odd.\"__ But, both weak and strong induction have to do with predicates over the _natural numbers_ --- and that's not the case here. So what do we do? \n",
    "\n",
    "What we do, is invent a new form of induction. This is a technique called __structural induction__ because it is induction on _structures_ instead of numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    ">Definition: __Structural induction__ is a proof technique that applies to recursively-defined structures whose framework consists of the following: \n",
    ">1. (_Base case_) Show that the predicate is true for all objects specified in the basis step of the recursive definition. \n",
    ">2. (_Inductive hypothesis_) Assume that the predicate is true for some arbitrary object that has already been constructed. \n",
    ">3. (_Inductive step_) Prove that by applying the recursive step of the definition to the object from the inductive hypothesis, that the predicate is true for the result. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same philosophy as strong and weak induction: (1) Establish that the beginning of the process works. Then (2) assume that the process has worked up to some arbitrary point. Then (3) prove that the process continues to work if you generate a new step. Structural induction decouples this idea from numbers, because we don't always work with numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a structural induction framework, along with a completed proof, for the proposition above about the odd length of strings in the set $S$. First of all, remember that the predicate $P(x)$ is the statement \"The length of $x$ is odd\". \n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Base case:__ Show that $P(x)$ is true for all the objects specified in the basis step of the definition of $S$. Those elements are the strings `a` and `b`, so the base case amounts to __showing that `a` and `b` have odd length__. (This is easy, right?) \n",
    "+ __Inductive hypothesis:__ Assume that $P(x)$ is true for some arbitrary object $x$ that has already been constructed. So in other words, suppose that $x$ is odd where $x$ is some element of $S$ that has already been constructed. \n",
    "+ __Inductive step:__ Prove that when we apply the recursive step of the definition to $x$, we get a new string whose length is odd. \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, a completed proof is shockingly simple: \n",
    "\n",
    ">__Proof:__ For the base case, we need to show that `a` and `b` have odd length. Well, their length is 1, so this is obvious. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Now suppose $x \\in S$ has odd length. We want to show that applying the recursive step to $x$ results in a new string of odd length, say $2k+1$ where $k$ is an integer. Applying the recursive step to $x$ results in the string $a + x + b$ (where `+` means concatenation). Since `a` and `b` have length 1, the length of the resulting string is $1 + (2k+1) + 1$ (where this time `+` means addition) and that equals $2k+3$, which is also odd. This is what we wanted to prove. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Review: An integer is odd if it can be written as $2k+1$ for some integer $k$. The number $2k+3$ is also odd because it can be written as $(2k+2) + 1$.) \n",

    "\n",
    "I have a nephew who recently completed his M.S. degree in Computer Science at a major American university. He's a smart guy but really struggled in his first year because _his undergrad courses never dealt much with proof by induction_. I asked him as I was putting the course together what he wished he had known better before starting graduate school and he gave me three answers: (1) induction, (2) induction, and (3) induction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical induction is the primary method of proof used by computer scientists because it is the flip side of recursion. Did you notice in the induction proof above that we used a recursive step to revert the proposition back to a simpler version of itself? This natural relationship between induction and recursion is one of the main unifying themes of the entire MTH 325 course. We will use induction ~~repeatedly~~ incessantly throughout the course to prove useful properties about relations, graphs, and trees -- anywhere recursive structures show up. Which is a lot. \n",
