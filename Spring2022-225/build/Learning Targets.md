# Standards/LTs for MTH 225 Spring 2022

1) I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16, including converting from one base to another using the base conversion algorithm, and represent a negative integer in base 2 using two's complement notation. 
3) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers in base 2. 
4) I can construct a truth table for propositions involving 2, 3, or 4 statements.
5) I can determine the value of a proposition that uses `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, or `NOT`. 
6) I can use truth tables to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent. 
7) Given a conditional statement, I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion, and I can write its converse, inverse, and contrapositive. 
8) I can determine the truth value of a predicate at a specific input and the truth value of a quantified predicate (or decide that the quantified predicate is underdetermined), including predicates with nested quantifiers.  
9)  I can state the negation of a quantified predicate. 
10) I can write a given set in both roster and set-builder form. 
11) I can determine if a set is a subset of another set, and I can determine if two sets are equal. 
12) I can determine the cardinality and the power set of a finite set. 
13) I can determine the complement of a set and the intersection, union, difference, and Cartesian product of two sets.
14) I can determine if a mapping between two sets is a function. 
15) I can identify the domain, range, and codomain of a function and determine the image of a speccific input. 
16) I can determine if a function is injective, surjective, and/or bijective. 
17) I can find values of the inverse of a bijective function and of the composition of two functions. 
18) I can compute values of the functions `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `DIV`, `%` (`MOD`), and `!` (`FACT`). 
19) I can apply the Additive and Multiplicative Principles and the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion to formulate and solve basic combinatorics problems. 
20) I can compute a binomial coefficient and apply the binomial coefficient to solve basic combinatorics problems. 
21) I can count the number of permutations of a group of objects and the number of $k$-permutations from a set of $n$ objects.
22) I can use the "stars and bars" method to count the number of ways to distribute objects among a group.
23) I can generate several values of a sequence given either a closed-form or recursive definition. 
24) I can use "sigma" and "pi" notation to find the sum and product of a sequence of numbers. 
25) I can find closed form and recursive definitions for arithmetic and geometric sequences. 
26) I can check the validity of a proposed closed-form solution to a recurrence relation. 
27) I can solve a second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation using the characteristic root method.
28) Given a statement to be proven by mathematical induction, I can identify the predicate, prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and sketch a proof.

**Advanced problem solving standards:** Not assessed through quizzes but through written work (maybe complete the induction one for a C; then induction + more for A/B)

- Apply the basic counting methods to solve more complex combinatorics problems 
- Give a combinatorial proof for an identity
- Outline a proof by mathematical induction 
- Generate a recurrence relation given a specific visual pattern
