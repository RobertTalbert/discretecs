# Standards/LTs for MTH 225 Spring 2022

1) I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16 and represent a negative integer in base 2 using two's complement notation. 
2) I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide integers in base 2. 
3) I can construct a truth table for propositions involving 2, 3, or 4 statements.
4) **MAYBE** I can determine the value of a proposition that uses `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, or `NOT`. 
5) I can use truth tables to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent. 
6) Given a conditional statement, I can identify the hypothesis and conclusion, and I can write its converse, inverse, and contrapositive. 
7) I can determine the truth value of a predicate at a specific input and the truth value of a quantified predicate (or decide that the quantified predicate is underdetermined), including predicates with nested quantifiers.  
8)  **MAYBE** I can state the negation of a quantified predicate. 
9)  I can write a given set in both roster and set-builder form.

16) I can find values of the inverse of a bijective function and of the composition of two functions. 
17) I can compute values of the functions `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `DIV`, `%` (`MOD`), and `!` (`FACT`). 
18) I can apply the Additive and Multiplicative Principles and the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion to formulate and solve basic combinatorics problems. 
19) I can compute a binomial coefficient and apply the binomial coefficient to solve basic combinatorics problems. 
20) I can count the number of permutations of a group of objects and the number of $k$-permutations from a set of $n$ objects.

**Advanced problem solving standards:** Not assessed through quizzes but through written work (maybe complete the induction one for a C; then induction + more for A/B)

- Apply the basic counting methods to solve more complex combinatorics problems 
- Give a combinatorial proof for an identity
- Outline a proof by mathematical induction 
- Generate a recurrence relation given a specific visual pattern
