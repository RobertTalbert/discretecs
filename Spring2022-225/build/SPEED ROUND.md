# SPEED ROUND 

## Modules

- ~~Binary~~ Computer arithmetic 
- Logic
- Sets and Functions 
- Sequences and recursion
- Combinatorics 
- Introduction to proof and mathematical induction 

Early insertion: What constitutes a good argument or solution; recursion early 

**Learning targets attached to each of the "skills" outcomes in the modules** 



## Assessment types

See/copy from: https://gradingforgrowth.com/p/case-study-hubert-muchalskis-hybrid?s=r 

- Quizzes covering the learning targets (most learning targets in the lower half of Bloom) 
  - Give twice weekly? Tues/Thurs with lt's appearing on three consecutive ones 
- Final exam = recertification on LTs 
- Homework for computation practice (just the LTs with maybe some higher level stuff) -- ideally this is electronic and self-graded 
- Problems -- upper levels of Bloom, give these whenever with expiration dates, grade EMRN; group these off by topic 

## Definition of A and C

- An "A" in this class looks like: All the core learning targets are passed (with two separate demonstrations of skill); nearly all the non-core ones are passed; reasonable engagement with practice problems has taken place; strong recertification on the final exam has happened; and at least a couple of problems from each group have been successfully (M+) completed with several Es. In other words: Evidence of mastery on the skills with strong showings on the applications and more difficult problems. 
- A "C" in this class looks like: Demonstrated skill on all core LTs but not necessarily mastery; also skill on half? of the non-core ones; a handful (small!) of problems solved successfully. 

*I'm noticing I'm not even thinking about Daily Prep. Is this a time when flipping a class isn't a good idea?* 

## Feedback loop 

- AEP's/problems are easy: They submit them on Bb or whatever, I grade them, they redo them, up to twice a week. Continue until passed. 
- If I can manage online homework, the feedback is in the system -- but students can also get help through a discussion board? (Maybe? These never seem to work out) 
- Quizzes -- students take the quiz, they get marks and written feedback, but I can also create solution videos at least for the first attempts; then they can retake. Offer live office hours reattempts up to two targets per week by appointment and ending in week 5.
