## About the instructor

I'm Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm a Professor of Mathematics and also work in the president's office as Presidential Fellow for the Advancement of Learning. This is my 30th year of teaching overall (not counting tutoring gigs). I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Vanderbilt University and a B.S. degree from Tennessee Tech University. 

I was, at best, a thoroughly mediocre math student in school until my senior year of high school, when I had a teacher for Calculus (hi, Mrs. Allen) who stopped trying to cram things into my head and instead showed me the basics and then backed off, and let me work with things (with support if I got stuck) until I came to my own understanding of them. Basically, this is how I teach today. 

After a two-year gig as a Psychology major in college, I changed my major to math after a late-night dare from my roommate (long story) and, to my great surprise, I fell in love with the subject. I ended up getting a Ph.D. working in an obscure area at the intersection of abstract algebra and geometry, and I also discovered I loved teaching math to college students. So I went on to spend 14 years teaching in small liberal arts colleges before coming to GVSU. 

Now, I teach computer scientists and engineers how to think like mathematicians, do research on how to make college teaching better, and coordinate large-scale teaching/learning projects for President Mantella's office. When nobody is looking I am always trying to build my skills in Python, data science, and project management. 

I live in Allendale with my wife, three teenage kids, and three cats. I am a halfway-decent cook, a longtime bass guitarist, and lover of the outdoors. I aspire to spend more time in a kayak or on a bike than in front of a computer. You can read more about what I'm thinking and doing at my website, [rtalbert.org](https://rtalbert.org), or at my "other blog" [Grading for Growth](https://gradingforgrowth.com) about alternative grading practices which I co-author with my GVSU college Prof. David Clark. I'm also on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) although I don't post much.
