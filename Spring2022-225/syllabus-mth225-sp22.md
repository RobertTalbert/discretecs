## About the Course 

In Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1, you'll be learning **the math that computer science is built on**. You'll learn things like how to do arithmetic in binary, how to count the number of ways to deal a five-card poker hand, and how to generate complex data structures using simple rules involving recursion. And more! By studying discrete structures, **you'll gain a superpower to make you an expert learner** of any hardware and any software, including those that haven't been invented yet. 


Your success in the course depends on three things: 

1. **Your willingness to be actively engaged during class time**. All the available research on learning says that the only way to learn is to be an active participant in the process. Active enagement means everything from keeping your camera on during meetings, to asking and answering questions during and between classes, and being actively involved during in-class breakout group work. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn. 
2. **Your willingness to ask questions**. The material in MTH 225 is challenging, and it is 100% certain you will be encountering things you don't fully understand at first. **This is totally normal.** But when it happens, you can't wait for it to make sense: *Ask questions* of me and your classmates and take action to make sense of the material. 
3. **Your ability to keep current and maintain awareness in the course**. Being a six-week course, the class moves at a *very* rapid pace. Each class meeting (135 minutes) is almost a *week's worth* of class time in a regular semester (150 minutes). To manage this, you will need to check messages and the calendar at once daily; get to work immediately on assignments; and above all **don't procrastinate** because there's just no room for it! 

If you can commit to those three things, then there is every expectation that you'll succeed in the course, no matter what your math background or perceived math skill is. 

**My #1 job as the professor is to make sure you succeed in learning.** Success in the course doesn't come cheap. Like learning to program, learning math involves hard work, a willingness to try things that might not work the first time, and the ability to improve using feedback. **But I promise you that I will work to make MTH 225 a class where you can make mistakes and grow safely and productively.** 


## Course Goals 

The overall goal of MTH 225 is to **build a solid foundation in the basic theory and tools for the mathematics that computer science is built on**, especially the theory and tools you will need for later coursework such as MTH 325 and CIS 263. 

**Course-level learning objectives:** Upon completion of MTH 225, you will be able to: 

* Represent integers using different number bases, and perform integer arithmetic using different bases and modular arithmetic.
* Formulate, manipulate, and determine the truth of logical expressions using symbolic logic.
* Formulate and solve computational problems using sets and functions.
* Formulate and solve complex counting problems using computational thinking and the tools of combinatorics.
* Evaluate numerical and other sequences using recursion, and solve simple recurrence relations.
* Write clear, correct, and convincing arguments to explain the correctness of a solution using combinatorial proof and mathematical induction.
* Explain the reasoning behind solutions to computational problems clearly to an appropriate audience.
* Apply effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
* Apply computer programming and computational thinking to frame and solve mathematical and computational problems.
* Self-assess one's work and apply feedback from others to make improvements in that work.

**Course module structure:** The course content is split up into five modules:

- **Module 1: Computer arithmetic**. Representing integers in binary, octal, and hexadecimal; binary arithmetic; two's complement notation for negative integers. 
- **Module 2: Logic**. Logical propositions, conditional statements, truth tables, predicates, and quantification. 
- **Module 3: Sets and functions**. Set notation and representation, set operations, functions (including special computer science functions). 
- **Module 4: Combinatorics**. The Additive and Multiplicative counting principles, the binomial coefficient, permutations, dots-and-dividers counting methods. 
- **Module 5: Recursion and induction**. Numerical sequences in closed-formula and recursive forms, solutions to recurrence relations, the Principle of Mathematical Induction and proof by induction. 

The basic skills that you'll learn in the course are encapsulated in a list of **21 Learning Targets**, eight (8) of which are labelled as **CORE** targets and represent the eight essential skills that every MTH 225 student should possess by the end of the course. You can find that list in the Appendix, and it's linked elsewhere on our various course sites. 

## MTH 225 Workflow 

Each class meeting has activities for you to do *before*, *during* and *after* the class. For details on specific assignment types, see the next section. 

* **Before class:** You'll be asked to complete a **Daily Prep** assignment that will involve you in reading a section of [the textbook](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/dmoi.html) and watching some of the videos at [our playlist](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8667148). You'll be engaging in questions and discussion about these using [Perusall](https://perusall.com/), and completing a small set of basic questions and exercises on a Google Form. This way, you'll come to class ready to work, and we can skip the lecturing in class unless it's really needed. 
* **During class:** Class meetings will be focused on *answering questions* and *doing active work*, both intended to make it easy for you to make sense of the material and ask questions. We'll also use time in class for assessment and for completing other assignments, so that a lot of the "homework" for the class is done during class time. 
* **After class:** In addition to getting started on the next Daily Prep, you should expect to spend significant time in between classes doing practice on concepts you don't fully understand yet, and asking questions. There will occasionally be **Application and Extension Problems** (AEPs) to work on as well. But, most of the work you do outside of class will be on Daily Prep. 

==maybe a diagram here==

Our class meetings are long --- 135 minutes. To make this productive, we'll structure our time in **30-minute blocks** (25 minutes of heads-down work followed by a 5-minute break): 

| Time | Focus | 
| :--- | :--- | 
| 1:00-1:30 | Q&A and review on the Daily Prep assignment; and a 5-minute break | 
| 1:30-2:00 | Focused group work on the main concept of the day; and a 5-minute break | 
| 2:00-2:30 | Focused group work on the main concept of the day; and a 5-minute break | 
| 2:30-3:00 | Free time to work on anything that's needed; and a 5-minute break | 
| 3:00-3:15 | Wrap up for the day, including daily response form | 

On days that involve Learning Target quizzes (below), we'll replace the 2:30-3:00 block with time to take assessments.

## Assessments and Grades 

You can only learn by doing things. The things you will do to learn include many things that are not assessed or graded, along with some items that are formally assessed and graded. These are: 

* **Daily Prep assignments**: These lead you through an active reading of portions of [the textbook](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/dmoi.html) and some of [the videos](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8667148). You'll use [Perusall](https://perusall.com/) to engage in discussions and questions on these, and complete a short form with basic exercises and questions. 
* **Learning Target completions**: Learning Targets are the basic skills that you should learn in the course. You will be asked to "complete" as many Learning Targets as possible, done mainly by taking short quizzes on them at regular intervals. See "Completing Learning Targets" below for more. 
* **Application and Extension Problems (AEPs)**: AEPs are problems that either *apply* or *extend* the basic skills found in the Learning Targets. They involve solving new-to-you problems and communicating your reasoning clearly to an appropriate audience.  
* **Online Practice**: You'll use the WeBWorK online homework system to practice the skills found in the Learning Targets. ==add link== 
* Final Exam

### Attendance, absences, and participation


### Deadlines and late work 

### Technology skills and tech support 

You should be proficient in the basic technology skills listed at [this GVSU policy page](https://www.gvsu.edu/online/technology-requirements-for-onlinehybrid-courses-8.htm). If you need help at any time with those skills, please ask me or a classmate. 

### Instructor availability and message responses 

**You have a right and the responsibility to ask a question about anything you don't fully understand, at any time.** To ask me questions, you can use email (talbertr@gvsu.edu), [the course Padlet](https://padlet.com/talbertr1/6itl6dvga4zytpc1), or drop-in hours or appointments.  

I do not always respond to all messages immediately because I have to prioritize a number of tasks throughout the week that make demands on my time; and I do not leave my email open all day. 

I typically respond to email and Padlet posts **once per day** in the late afternoon. If you send a message on a weekday (Monday through Friday) before 4:00pm ET, it will get a **same-day response**. Messages sent after 4:00pm on Fridays or on the weekends will get a response **no later than the following Monday afternoon**. Please note: If you have a significant question over a weekend, your best bet is to post it to [the course Padlet](https://padlet.com/talbertr1/6itl6dvga4zytpc1) where it will be seen by the entire class, so you might get an answer before Monday.

## About the instructor

I'm Robert Talbert, the professor for this course. I'm a Professor of Mathematics and also work in the president's office as Presidential Fellow for the Advancement of Learning. This is my 30th year of teaching overall (not counting tutoring gigs). I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Vanderbilt University and a B.S. degree from Tennessee Tech University. 

I was, at best, a thoroughly mediocre math student in school until my senior year of high school, when I had a teacher for Calculus (hi, Mrs. Allen) who stopped trying to cram things into my head and instead showed me the basics and then backed off, and let me work with things (with support if I got stuck) until I came to my own understanding of them. Basically, this is how I teach today. 

After a two-year gig as a Psychology major in college, I changed my major to math after a late-night dare from my roommate (long story) and, to my great surprise, I fell in love with the subject. I ended up getting a Ph.D. working in an obscure area at the intersection of abstract algebra and geometry, and I also discovered I loved teaching math to college students. So I went on to spend 14 years teaching in small liberal arts colleges before coming to GVSU. 

Now, I teach computer scientists and engineers how to think like mathematicians, do research on how to make college teaching better, and coordinate large-scale teaching/learning projects for President Mantella's office. When nobody is looking I am always trying to build my skills in Python, data science, and project management. 

I live in Allendale with my wife, three teenage kids, and three cats. I am a halfway-decent cook, a longtime bass guitarist, and lover of the outdoors. I aspire to spend more time in a kayak or on a bike than in front of a computer. You can read more about what I'm thinking and doing at my website, [rtalbert.org](https://rtalbert.org), or at my "other blog" [Grading for Growth](https://gradingforgrowth.com) about alternative grading practices which I co-author with my GVSU college Prof. David Clark. I'm also on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) although I don't post much.
