### May 10

**Focus:** Binary arithmetic and two's complement 

- Block 1 (QA)
  - QA over Daily Prep 
  - Polling over Daily Prep 
- Block 2 (AL) 
  - Breakout groups -- each group gets an addition, subtraction, multiplication, division problem and a two's complement situaton -- put work on breakout board 
- Block 3 (Discuss and correct) 
  - Spend 10 minutes visiting other group's boards and leaving sticky notes about questions or corrections 
- End: Quiz over LT 1 and LT 2 and what it's all about (give some time in class, but it's not fully due until 11:59pm ET) 

### May 11

**Focus:** Propositions and truth tables 

- Block 1 (QA)
  - QA over Daily Prep 
  - Polling over Daily Prep 
- Block 2 (AL) 
  - Breakout groups -- each group gets two propositions -- one with two variables, another with three -- make the truth tables. If time, do another. 
- Block 3 (Discuss and correct) 
  - Spend 10 minutes visiting other group's boards and leaving sticky notes about questions or corrections 
  - STATIONS -- one for LT 1, another for LT 2, another for LT 3 -- pick a station and join/leave breakout groups freely. Work on items at the breakout boards (do on your own, use the board area for discussion if needed) -- also a "work quietly on my own" room with no breakout board
- Wrap up and preview
