# MTH 225 Assessment/grading brainstorming 

## Second draft

- Preclass assignments "Daily Prep" 
  - The usual assignments with videos etc., graded 0/1 on completeness and effort 
  - Then, beginning of class is a 5-minute pair quiz over subset of the Daily Prep followed by debrief. Quiz graded 0/1 on correctness 
    - What if students are late, sick, etc.? Maybe set these up in advance on Bb, open them up 1 hour before class --- or give option to do them individually at the end of class, or through an oral makeup 
- Learning Targets 
  - So far 20 of these with 8-10 Core. 
  - Level up by demonstrating skill: 
    - On a LT quiz/checkpoint 
    - On an oral assessment
    - Through a video demo 
    - Through a make-you-own (permission needed first) 
  - One successful demo: Level up 0 -> 1
  - Two successful demos: Level up 1 -> 2. 
- Weekly Problems 
  - Mid-level Bloom's taxonomy stuff plus metacognition 
  - Can collaborate up to 3 people, must be in own words 
  - Reviseable twice with rolling deadlines 
  - Graded Pass/Revise/Incomplete
  - Parts of WPs are integrated into the class meetings 
- AEPs
  - Six total 
  - Advanced/creative type problems including programming, also crypto
  - Graded on three levels (Pass, Revise, Incomplete) 
- Final exam -- comprehensive over Core plus randomly selected/self selected other targets + some big picture items. For +/- mods only, can use to level up one last time.
