# MTH 225 Assessment/grading brainstorming 

- **Preclass assignments** 
- Basics: 
  - **Learning Targets** -- subset of overall learning objectives list for lessons
    - Some designated Core 
    - Demonstrate skill:
      - On Checkpoints 
      - Through oral exams 
      - Through video demos 
      - Through make-your-own
    - Level 1: One successful skill demonstration 
    - Level 2: Two successful skill demonstrations
    - Give specifications and descriptions in advance 
- Advanced: 
  - Weekly homework
    - Extended work on mid-level concepts 
  - AEPs
    - Fewer of these this time -- maybe one per module plus a couple more
    - Like mini-projects 
- Final exam 
  - It's a final round of Learning Target assessments, all of them
  - Students must do the core plus as many others as they can 
  - Adjusts course grade with +/-
