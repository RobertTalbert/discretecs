# MTH 225 Learning Targets 

- I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16 and represent a negative integer in base 2. 
- I can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in binary (base 2). 
- I can identify the parts of a conditional statement and write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement. 
- I can construct truth tables for propositions involving two or three variables and use truth tables to determine if two propositions are logically equivalent. 
- I can identify the truth value of a predicate, determine whether a quantified predicate is true or false, and state the negation of a quantified statement. 
- I can represent a set in roster notation and set-builder notation; determine if an object is an element of a set; and determine set relationships (equality, subset). 
- I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set.
- I can determine whether or not a given relation is a function, determine the domain and codomain of a function, and find the image and preimage of a point using a function.
- I can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.
- I can evaluate special computer science functions: floor, ceiling, factorial, `DIV`, and `MOD` (`%`).
- I can use the additive and multiplicative principles and the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to formulate and solve counting problems. 
- I can calculate a binomial coefficient and correctly apply the binomial coefficient to formulate and solve counting problems.
- I can count the number of permutations of a group of objects and the number of $k$-permutations from a set of $n$ objects.
- I can use the "stars and bars" method to count the number of ways to distribute objects among a group.
- I can generate several values in a sequence defined using a closed-form expression or using recursion.
- I can use sigma notation to rewrite a sum and determine the sum of an expression given in sigma notation. 
- I can find closed-form and recursive expressions for arithmetic and geometric sequences.
- I can determine a recurrence relation for a given recursive sequence and check whether a proposed solution to that relation is valid. 
- I can solve a second-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation using the characteristic root method. 
- Given a statement to be proven by mathematical induction, I can state and prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and outline the proof.
