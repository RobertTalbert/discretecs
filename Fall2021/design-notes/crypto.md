# Integrating cryptography in MTH 225

**Idea: Build a free-standing minicourse on crypto within MTH 225 that uses the concepts from the course.** 

- Students engage with as much or as little as desired; this will stand in for weekly homework or whatever assessment I choose. 
- Or do I want to require some initial portion of this for all students -- then they can go deeper? 
- Includes programming assignments
- Needs explicit ties back to the math concepts 

## Very basic outline

- Fundamentals
	- Plaintext, ciphertext, key
	-
