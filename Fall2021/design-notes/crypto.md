# Integrating cryptography in MTH 225

**Idea: Build a free-standing minicourse on crypto within MTH 225 that uses the concepts from the course.** 

- Students engage with as much or as little as desired; this will stand in for weekly homework or whatever assessment I choose. 
- Or do I want to require some initial portion of this for all students -- then they can go deeper? 
- Includes programming assignments
- Needs explicit ties back to the math concepts 

## Very basic outline

- Fundamentals
	- Plaintext, ciphertext, key
- Specific cryptosystems
	- Substitution ciphers
		- Caesar; shift
		- Cryptograms (monoalphabetic) 
			- Number of keys for a cryptogram (*factorial*) 
		- Decimation; affine 
			- Valid keys for decimation cipher (*concept of GCD and Euclidean algorithm*) 
		- Vigenere (polyalphabetic) 
	- Transposition ciphers
		- Rail fence, columnar transposition, etc. 
	- One time pad 
	- Computer ciphers
		- XOR 
		- S-DES 
	- Public-key 
		- Kid Crypto
		- RSA 
		- El Gamal
- Other crypto concepts
	- 
- Digital signatures
