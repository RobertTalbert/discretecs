# Integrating cryptography in MTH 225

**Idea: Build a free-standing minicourse on crypto within MTH 225 that uses the concepts from the course.** 

- Students engage with as much or as little as desired; this will stand in for weekly homework or whatever assessment I choose. 
- Or do I want to require some ini
- Includes programming assignments
- Needs explicit ties back to the math concepts 

## Brainstorming an outline
