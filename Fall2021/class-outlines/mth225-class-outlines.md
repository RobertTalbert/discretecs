  - Daily Prep (:00-:10)
    - Instructions: Today we practice. Everyone gets a 1 on this one if you participate. But let's run through the process to give a feel for how it will work. At table groups: Pair off, or stay in a 3. On tables are paper slips with quiz items, plus space for questions or comments. Fill those out in your small groups. Will collect in 5 minutes. 
    - Do and collect. 
    - Review (with a clicker question) and how to check answers using online tools. 
  - Activity (:10-:30)
    - Simple practice, convert random decimal integers to base 2, 8, 16. Convert other bases to decimal. Convert base 8,16 to base 2 and vv. 
    - Convert powers of 2 to binary, what do we notice? 
    - Convert one less than power of 2 to binary, what do we notice? 
    - Convert even numbers to binary. Convert odd numbers to binary. What do we notice? 
    - If a decimal number has N digits, how many binary digits will it have? In general, how many bits will it take to store an N digit decimal number? 
  - Debrief activity (:30-:40)
  - Wrap up (:40-:50) 
    - Recap
    - Coming up next: DP 1.2, this time we will score for real 
    - Time for metacognitive questions
- F 9/3
  - Welcome
  - Daily Prep
    - Instructions: At table groups, get into pairs or triples. Work together to complete the quiz in front of you. 5 minutes. (No work needed.) 
    - Follow up with clicker question 
    - Q&A
  - Activity (:10-20 then 20-40 for the second/at the board part)
    - Review of converting back/forth to and from decimal and binary 
    - Which is larger? 
    - Basic addition and subtraction practice 
    - Do one addition, one subtraction per table pair at the board using randomly generated 8-bit integers. Highlight where carrying/borrowing take place and show the work-check step.  
  - Wrap up (:40-:50) 
    - Recap
    - Coming up next: No class Monday because Labor Day. DP 1.3 due Tuesday night. Multiplication and division. 
    - Time for metacognitive questions

- M 9/6: Nothing, Labor Day
- W 9/8
  - Practice with multiplication and division 
  - review from earlier classes 
- F 9/10

## Week 3

- M 9/13
  - Review from Module 1
  - Polling over high level concepts and identification
  - Practice with forming contrapositive, etc.

  - Practice making truth tables and determining logical equivalence --- esp logical equivalence of conditional and contrapositive, NON equivalence of conditional and converse; equivalence of negation and p & ~ q
- F 9/17
  - Practice with evaluating predicates. finding truth sets of predicates; are predicates always true, sometimes true, never true

## Week 4

- M 9/20
  - Take predicates from 9/17 and evaluate truth values of quantifications; determining truth values of double quantified statements; connection to FOR loops  
- W 9/22
  - Polling over basic ideas
  - Practice with basic ideas
  - Proper set builder notation and connection to predicates; which are semantically correct? 
  - Is this object an element of this set? 
- F 9/24: Day for LT quizzing
