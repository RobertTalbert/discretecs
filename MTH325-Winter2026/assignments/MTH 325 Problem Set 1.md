# MTH 325 Problem Set 1

Submit solutions on or before **11:59pm Eastern time on Friday, February 6** in order to be eligible for engagement credits. 


## Instructions

Welcome to your first Problem Set. The purpose of this Problem Set is to apply and extend the basic ideas from our recent classes. 

- To submit your work on a Problem Set, please TYPE up your solutions and save them as a PDF, then upload the PDF to the designated area on Blackboard (in the Problem Sets folder). **Handwritten work is not accepted.**
- These Problem Sets are **not graded directly**. They are only given formative feedback that you can use to improve your work. You may resubmit a new draft of a Problem Set at any time, by making a new draft and uploading that to the same designated area on Blackboard where the first draft went. 
- **Application/Analysis Exam problems will be selected from among problems that appear on Problem Sets**. So it is to your advantage to submit Problem Sets and use the feedback to refine your solutions. 
- You will receive 8 engagement credits for turning in a **good-faith complete attempt at a Problem Set prior to its deadline**. This means: Every part of every problem must contain an attempt that represents an honest try at a full and complete solution.

## Problem 1: Even squares

Consider this proposition: 

If $n^3$ is an even integer, then $n$ is an even integer.

1. Set up a proof for this statement that would use a **direct proof**. That is: State what you would assume, then state what you would prove. Do not try to give a proof yet. 
2. Set up a proof for this statement that would use **proof using the contrapositive**. That is: State what you would assume, then state what you would prove. Do not try to give a proof yet. 
3. Set up a proof for this statement that would use **proof by contradiction**. That is: State all the assumptions you would make. Do not try to give a proof yet.
4. Looking over your three setups, which approach to the proof seems best to you, and why? Then, write a complete and correct proof using that approach. 


## Problem 2: Fibonacci numbers

The **Fibonacci** numbers are numbers in a sequence determined by the following recursive definition: The first two Fibonacci numbers $F_0$ and $F_1$ are defined to be $F_0 = 1$ and $F_1 = 1$. And, for all $k > 1$, $F_k = F_{k-1} + F_{k-2}$. That is, every other Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two. Therefore $F_2 = 2$, $F_3 = 3$, $F_4 = 5$, $F_5 = 8$, $F_6 = 13$, and so on. See [the vault article](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Recursion/Fibonacci+sequence) for more. 

1. Prove that every third Fibonacci number (that is, $F_2$, $F_5$, $F_8$, etc.) is even. 
2. Prove that for all nonnegative integers $n$, $F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1$. 

**Suggestions**: 
- Play with these ideas first. For example, add up $F_0$ through $F_{10}$ and verify that you actually get $F_{12} - 1$. (This is what the second problem would predict if $n=10$.)
- Think about what proof techniques would fit the situation, then which one works best. Then follow the framework for that technique.
