# Problem Set 1

## Instructions

Welcome to your first Problem Set. The purpose of this Problem Set is to apply and extend the basic ideas from our recent classes. 

- To submit your work on a Problem Set, please TYPE up your solutions and save them as a PDF, then upload the PDF to the designated area on Blackboard (in the Problem Sets folder). **Handwritten work is not accepted.**
- These Problem Sets are **not graded directly**. They are only given formative feedback that you can use to improve your work. You may resubmit a new draft of a Problem Set at any time, by making a new draft and uploading that to the same designated area on Blackboard where the first draft went. 
- **Application/Analysis Exam problems will be selected from among problems that appear on Problem Sets**. So it is to your advantage to submit Problem Sets and use the feedback to refine your solutions. 
- You will receive 8 engagement credits for turning in a **good-faith complete attempt at a Problem Set prior to its deadline**. This means: Every part of every problem must contain an attempt that represents an honest try at a full and complete solution.

## Problem 1: An inequality about fractions

Prove that for all real numbers $a$ and $b$, if $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, then $\dfrac{2}{a} + \dfrac{2}{b} \neq \dfrac{4}{a+b}$. 

*Note*: We looked at this proposition briefly in a polling activity on 2026-01-26. 


## Problem 2: Divisibility by 7

Prove that $2^{n+2} + 3^{2n+1}$ is divisible by $7$ for all positive integers $n$. 

*Note:* An integer $k$ is "divisible by $7$" if there exists an integer $q$ such that $k = 7q$. For example $35$ is divisible by $7$ by taking $q = 5$.
