## First things

**Welcome to 325! Before you read any further, please know these four very important facts:**

1. **I (your professor) want you to be successful in the course**. My literal job is to guide through the content of the course so you are learning things that are cool and useful. I wouldn't be working here if I felt otherwise. You can trust me. 
2. **Learning happens by doing things, not by hearing things**. The only way humans learn is by doing things, then getting feedback, and then trying again and repeating this loop until learning happens. The course is centered around active work rather than lecture, for this reason. 
3. **Success comes from taking small steps consistently and trusting the process**. Doing big things inconsistently (like 8-hour cram sessions done only before exams) doesn't work. Instead, it's easier. All you are expected to do is show up daily and do the work, and consistency will win every time.  
4. **You will hit roadblocks and have questions, and that's normal**. You wouldn't be taking a class if you already knew everything. At some point you'll feel lost and have questions. That's when you're learning the fastest and helping you through that is my favorite part of the job.

## About MTH 325

### Course content 

MTH 325 is the sequel to MTH 225, where you learned many foundational topics in computer science including integer arithmetic, propositional logic, set theory and function, and principles of counting as well as the basic notions of mathematical proof focusing on proof by induction. [Click here for a current MTH 225 syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20225%20W26%20syllabus.md) for more details. 

In MTH 325, you'll extend these ideas to learn about four important and related ideas that are essential to computer science: 

- **Mathematical proof**: Introduced in MTH 225, [mathematical proofs](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Logic/Proof) are explanations of why a [proposition](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Logic/Propositions) about an observation is always true. In MTH 225 you learned one approach to mathematical proof, namely [mathematical induction](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Proof/Mathematical+induction). In MTH 325, we expand on induction and introduce several other forms of proof. 
- **Graphs**: A [graph](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Graphs/Graph) is an abstracted data structure used to model a network. They are of central importance to computer science, and in MTH 325 you'll learn how to apply them to real-life networks and determine information about those networks using mathematics. 
- **Trees and search**: A [tree](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Trees/Tree) is a special kind of graph that is encountered frequently in computer science, especially in different approaches to search algorithms and information systems.
- **Directed graphs and relations**: A [directed graph](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Directed+Graphs+and+Relations/Directed+graph) (or "digraph") is a graph whose connections have direction. One special use of digraphs is to model [relations](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Directed+Graphs+and+Relations/Relation), which are abstracted forms of relational databases. 

Additionally, MTH 325 focuses on **essential critical thinking and communications skills**: 

- *Critical evaluation*: Being able to look at a program, problem solution, or explanation -- especially those you create -- and find and fix errors and misconceptions in it.
- *Deliberate practice*: Practicing a skill with focused attention and a goal of improving performance.
- *Good explanations*: Taking a complex idea and making it make sense to a normal, non-expert human being through a clear, correct, and complete verbal explanation.

### Learning objectives and catalog description

Upon completion of MTH 225, you will be able to:

- Construct a logical framework for a proof using mathematical induction, direct proof, proof by contraposition, or proof by contradiction.
- Analyze the structure and validity of a mathematical proof.
- Compute basic information about graphs, relations, and trees.
- Solve theoretical and applied problems involving applications of basic concepts of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Formulate computational problems in terms of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Employ effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
- Explain methods and solutions of computational problems in a clear way to a specified target audience.
- Demonstrate fluency in applying algorithms in the formulation and solutions of mathematical problems.
- Assess your own work in mathematical problem solving and apply feedback to make improvements to your own work.
    
**Catalog description**: Continuation of MTH 225 with emphasis on mathematical proof and graph-related structures. Review of mathematical induction; strong induction and structural induction; direct proof, proof by contraposition, and proof by contradiction; graphs and their representations and properties; relations, equivalence relations, and partial orderings; trees and tree traversals. Offered fall and winter semesters. Prerequisite: [MTH 225](https://www.gvsu.edu/catalog/course/mth-225.htm).

This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.

## Class meetings and class preparation

MTH 325 is set up so that you will be **actively engaged -- before, during, and after class meetings.** 

- *Before class:* You'll complete a **Class Prep** assignment that contains *review questions* from the previous class meeting, a *reading or video selection* to introduce new ideas for the next class, and *preview questions* to make sure you have the basic knowledge for the next class. Class Prep assignments are essential for being fully prepared; **class meetings pick up where Class Prep assignments end, and we will not typically re-teach any material from Class Preps**.
- *During class:* Class meetings typically start with a low-stakes **entry quiz** over the pre-class material, followed by going over that quiz and other questions from Class Prep. Then the middle 20-30 minutes of each session is spent on active practice and problem solving. Finally, meetings typically end with time for questions and discussion on the activities and instructions for the next meeting. 
- *After class:* Your main job in between classes is to complete Class Prep and engage in good practice on your own, along with occasional problem sets (described later). The majority of what is normally considered "homework" is replaced by Class Prep. 

**IMPORTANT Note #1**: **Class meetings are active practice sessions on content that is *beyond the basics*.** There are typically no full-length lectures in class meetings. Instead, you are expected to learn the basics (like definitions of terms and simple calculations) through Class Prep assignments, then come ready to apply the basics to more advanced questions. 

**IMPORTANT Note #2:**  Class Prep assignments are simple, and are only graded on completeness and effort. **But they are not optional and should be given full effort**. Failing to complete Class Preps with your full attention will lower your grade both directly and indirectly, and you will be lost during class meetings. Remember there is no re-teaching of the material you are expected to learn on Class Preps. 

**IMPORTANT Note #3**: **Consistent attendance of class meetings is essential for full understanding of the course material**. If you skip class, you are getting no help with the most difficult parts of the content. Additionally, attendance will be taken each day and factored into your grade (see below for how). This includes days that are adjacent to holidays.

## Course work 

### Overall approach to assignments

In MTH 325, your learning will take place in three different, complementary categories: 

- *Mastery of basic building-block skills*, which in the course we call **Learning Targets**.
- *Application of basic skills*, which happen through ungraded **Weekly practice** and biweekly **Problem Sets** and which are tested on **Application/Analysis Exams**.  
- *Engagement in the course*, by earning **engagement credits**. 

Here are the details on each of these. 

### Learning Targets

The basic, foundational building blocks of the course are summarized in a list of 12 **Learning Targets**. The complete list appears in Appendix A of this syllabus. Five (5) of these are highlighted as **Core Learning Targets** because they are [specifically highlighted by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)](http://ccecc.acm.org/pdfs/discrete-structures-course.pdf) as essential skills for all computing professionals. Our class is organized around those 12 Learning Targets. We will be covering one Learning Target per week on average and spending class time on practice of these. 

Three times this semester you will take a **Learning Target exam** that assesses your skills with a group of Learning Targets. Each exam will consist of one problem per Learning Target that has been covered in the class so far: Exam 1 will cover Learning Targets 1--4, Exam 2 will cover Learning Targets 1--8, and Exam 3 will cover Learning Targets 1--12. Note that each exam is cumulative. See below for how these are graded. 

### Weekly Practice and Problem Sets

Every week, you'll receive a set of **practice exercises** over recent content, which are given on Blackboard and should be completed there. These will include multiple-choice and true/false items with some short-answer and computational questions. 

Less frequently (typically every 2 weeks) you'll receive a **Problem Set** that contains more advanced problems that apply the basic material. These are to be written up on your own and a PDF of your work submitted to an assignment area on Blackboard. 

### Application/Analysis Exams

To test your skills with application and analysis in the course, there are two **Application/Analysis Exams**. Each consists of four parts. First is a collection of items that are either **directly taken from practice exercise sets**, or are substantially similar to these. Then, there will be three groups of 2-3 problems each, including some problems that are again either **directly taken from Problem Sets** or which are substantially similar to these. You will be asked to choose one problem to solve from each group. 

### Engagement credits

Opportunities to engage with the class so are plentiful, and many will have a point value attached, which we call **engagement credits**. Some engagement credit opportunities are recurring (for example, successful completion of Class Prep and class attendance both earn engagement credits) while some are one-time opportunities that encourage going above and beyond basic engagement (for example, the Startup Assignment given in week 1). All such opportunities to earn engagement credits will be clearly announced. 

### Final exam

There is no final exam in this course. Instead, the final exam period will be used for any last-minute reattempts of previous assessments that may be needed. (See "Reattempts of assessments" below.) The final exam session will be held in your section's usual classroom, on **Wednesday April 29 from 12:00-1:50pm**.

## Grading system

### Overall method of grading

Grading in MTH 325 works differently than it possibly does in your other courses and in high school. In MTH 325: 

- **Almost none of your assignments have point values**. (The exception is engagement credit items.) Therefore there is **no partial credit and no averaging** because there are no points. 
- Instead, assignments have **standards** which are descriptions of what constitutes "successful" work. These are given in detail in the document [Standards for Student Work in MTH 325](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%2026.md), described in more detail below. 
- Rather than attaching point values to items, I use the [*Standards for Student Work* document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%2026.md) to see if the work meets the standard for "success". Depending on the extent to which your work meets the standard or doesn't meet it, it will be marked with one of two or three adjectives that describe it. See "How assignments are graded and recorded in Blackboard" below for more. 
- After I grade your work, in most cases you will receive **detailed feedback** that will tell you whether your work meets the standards, and if not, the feedback will tell you what was missing and how you might go about fixing it. 
- On Exams (both Learning Target and Application/Analysis), you will have the chance to **reattempt** items on the exam if needed so you can put the feedback you received to work and improve on the second attempt. 
- Your course grade is not based on point totals or averages (because there are no point values). Instead, the course grade is based on **how many learning tasks you've successfully accomplished** by the end of the semester, using a simple table that's given below. 

**Why is grading so weird in this class?** I believe in your ability to learn from mistakes and eventually master every part of the material in MTH 325. In order to give room for learning from mistakes, we need reattempts on things. And to make sure you know what to reattempt, your work needs to be marked with something other than points because points do not tell you what you know or don't know. Also, when there are points on assignments, you're only human and will tend to focus like a laser on the points and not on the things you need to work on. I'm no different. So we've removed points from the picture to focus on the right things; added clear standards for acceptable work so you will know where you stand; and a system of reattempts so you can keep trying if you don't meet the standard the first time. I don't care so much if you know or don't know something at a single moment -- but I care a lot about whether you can *eventually* learn it. 

This approach mirrors how things work in the real world and in most places in life outside of school. Once you have a real job, for example, your boss is not going to attach a point value to your performance reviews and then choose to fire or retain you based on that point total. Instead, you have performance standards, you get feedback and coaching on how to improve, and then you act on the feedback and show the boss that you have improved. 

The main drawback of this approach to grading is that it's different and might take getting used to. I've done grading this way for over 10 years now, and I find that most students need no more than a week before they are fully comfortable with this. I encourage you to ask questions at any time so I can help you. 

### The _Standards for Student Work_ document 

The [Standards for Student Work in MTH 325](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%2026.md) document is a complete one-stop visit for all information about what "success" specifically looks like for each of the assignment types in the course. **It is critically important that you read this document carefully and keep it close at hand**. A link is to it is found in several places in the syllabus, also on the [Class Page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWiOifmBieQYdwgCST8vJBBfraYd3YZsztRM6bnH6d4/edit?usp=sharing) and on Blackboard; you should also bookmark it in your web browser. 

### How assignments are graded and recorded in Blackboard

* *Learning Targets*: Learning Target exams themselves do not receive a grade. Instead, each Learning Target is graded separately, and recorded separately in Blackboard. Each is graded with one of three markings: *Master*, *Proficient*, or *Beginner*. Please see the [Standards for Student Work document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%2026.md) for the criteria for each. 
* *Weekly practice*: You will get a score on these once you complete them on Blackboard, to show you how many responses you got correct. Earning 100% correct will earn you engagement credits (see below). Otherwise the score does not contribute to or take away from your course grade at all. 
* *Problem Sets*: Turning in a good-faith effort at a complete and correct set of solutions on a Problem Set will earn you engagement credits (see below). Otherwise these are ungraded; you will be given verbal feedback on any problem set or part of one that you submit, but they do not by themselves earn credit. 
* *Application/Analysis Exams*: Each Application/Analysis Exam has four parts (multiple choice/true false, and three problem groups). Each part is graded *Success* or *Retry* and will be recorded separately in Blackboard. The exam as a whole is graded *Master*, *Proficient*, or *Beginner* depending on how many of the four parts were marked *Success*. Please see the [Standards for Student Work document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%2026.md) for the specific criteria. 

### Engagement credits

You can earn *engagement credits* for completing tasks in the course that are not direct evidence of your learning, like exams, but which are important for the learning process. 

| Action                                                  | Engagement credits earned |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Successful completion of a Class Prep                   | 1                         |
| Attending a class meeting* (30 minute minmum)           | 1                         |
| Completing weekly practice set with 100%                | 4                         |
| Turning in good-faith complete attempt at a Problem Set | 8                         |
\*Does not include exam days, reattempt days, or exam makeup days. 

Please see the [Standards for Student Work document](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20Standards%20for%20Student%20Work%20Winter%2026.md) for the specific criteria for successful completions of these tasks. Other, one-time opportunities for earning engagement credits may arise during the semester. 

### How the course grade is determined

Your letter grade for the course is assigned using the table below. It shows the *minimum* requirements for the "base grades" of A, B, C, and D. **To earn a grade in the course, you need to meet or exceed *all* the requirements for that grade.** Plus/minus modifiers are applied using the rules below the table. A grade of "F" is assigned if not all of the requirements for a "D" are met.

|     | Learning Targets with "Master" | Application/Analysis Exams                 | Engagement Credits |     |
| :-: | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------ | --- |
|  A  | 11                             | *Master* on both                           | 90% of maximum\*   |     |
|  B  | 9                              | *Master* on one, *Proficient* on the other | 80% of maximum     |     |
|  C  | 7                              | *Proficient* on both                       | 70% of maximum     |     |
|  D  | 5                              | Proficient on one                          | 60% of maximum     |     |

Note: The final maximum number of engagement credits will not be known until roughly week 10. A running maximum total will be kept on Blackboard, updated weekly, so you can check your current percentage. 

The base grade can be modified with a plus or minus: 
- *Plus:* Given when Learning Targets mastered and Application/Analysis exams are at different levels. In this case, **we take the grade level of the lower of those two and add a plus to it.**  Example: Earning mastery on 11 Learning Targets ("A" level), 80% of the maximum amount of engagement credits ("B" level) but having only proficient on both Application/Analysis exams("C" level) is a C+. 
- *Minus:* Given when engagement credits are lower than Learning Targets or Application/Analysis exams. In this case, **we take the grade level of the lower of those two and add a minus to it**. Example: Earning mastery on 11 Learning Targets ("A" level), *Master* on both Application/Analysis exams (also "A" level), and fewer than 50% of the maximum possible engagement credits, would be an A-. 

In cases where both a plus and a minus could be awarded, there is no modifier. Example: 11 Learning Targets mastered, only *Proficient* on the two Application/Analysis exams, and fewer than 60% of possible engagement credits (A, C, and F levels respectively) would qualify both for a C+ and a C-, so a C is the course grade. 

**CORE Learning Targets:** Five of the 12 Learning Targets are designated **CORE** targets. Failing to earn *Master* rating on all five of these will result in a one-letter grade penalty to your course grade. 

**Borderline cases:** If you are close to satisfying the requirements for a grade, but not quite satisfying it, I will consider such borderline cases on a case-by-case basis at the end of the seemester using engagement credits as the primary means of deciding. Please note that having only one *Master* on an Application/Analysis exam is not considered "close to" having two of them. 

---
## Reattempts of assessments

A feature of this course is that **you can redo many of your assessments** to take feedback into account and make improvements to your understanding. This is what is offered instead of partial credit, and it's expected that you will make use of this opportunity and learn through it. Here are the details. 

### Reattempts of Learning Targets

Learning Target exams are cumulative. Each version contains new versions of problems for all previously tested Learning Targets, along with new Learning Targets. The plan for coverage of Learning Targets on each is shown below: 

| Learning Target Exam |        Date        | Learning Targets covered |     |
| :------------------: | :----------------: | :----------------------: | --- |
|          1           |    February 11     |           1--4           |     |
|          2           |      March 6       |           1--8           |     |
|          3           |      April 8       |          1--12           |     |
|     (Final exam)     | See above for time |          1--12           |     |

(These dates may change; always [check the official course calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fce0ab714102f433750e60ad2eefaaa2a9bd6d972a471eb2f16bc1ce75972063%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FDetroit) for finalized dates.)

Only a mark of *Master* counts toward the course grade. If you attempt a problem for a Learning Target on an exam and don't earn *Master* on it, **you can try it again at the next exam and on the final exam**. This will allow you several different attempts possible on each Learning Target. The last two weeks of class are set aside for reassessments as well, and during those times we may have smaller, targeted "mini-exams" on specific Learning Targets, especially the Core Learning Targets and Learning Targets introduced later in the course. 

### Reattempts of Application/Analysis Exams

Each Application/Analysis exam has a designated day for reattempts on that exam: 

- Application/Analysis Exam 1 reattempt: **March 4**
- Application/Analysis Exam 2 reattempt: **April 22**

If you earned *Master* or are otherwise happy with your initial attempt on an exam, you are not required to attend the reattempt session. The reattempt will consist of a new exam, similar but not identical to the first one. Unlike the initial attempt, the reattempt may not include problems taken directly from Problem Sets and weekly practice, so it's to your advantage to do as well as possible the first time. 

**Only the indicated exam may be reattempted on each date.** Exam 1 may not be reattempted at Exam 2's reattempt session or vice-versa. However, **both exams may be reattempted during the final exam session** along with any Learning Targets that may need reattempts. 

### Makeup date for Application/Analysis exams

The class session on **Friday April 17** is set aside for students needing a makeup of an *initial* attempt of an Application/Analysis exam that is missed for valid medical or personal reasons. This date is not to be used for *reattempts* of a previously-taken Application/Analysis exam. Absences from both Application/Analysis exams, or absences from the reattempt session for Application/Analysis Exam 1, will be handled as needed. 

Makeups of Application/Analysis exams are not intended to be offered outside of normal class time; that's to be done on the makeup date. 

### Other assignments

Reattempts are not available on other assignments, including Class Prep, weekly practice, or Problem Sets. These are primarily graded on completeness and effort using engagement credits.

## Academic integrity and technology use 

This course is subject to [GVSU course policies](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/) and the [GVSU student code](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/7B58A5E7-F4C2-114C-CCDA36F96BD2AF73/the_statement_final_fa2020(2).pdf). This document establishes guidelines and expands and clarifies these policies with respect to all work done in MTH 325 this semester. Every student is required to be familiar with these policies and the consequences of violating them.

The student code defines *academic misconduct* as "any action or behavior that misrepresents one’s contributions to or the results of any scholarly product submitted for credit, evaluation, or dissemination". These include:

- *Cheating*: Attempting to use materials, information, or aids that have not been authorized by the instructor for academic work.
- *Collusion*: Unauthorized collaboration with another person in preparing academic assignments offered for credit, and collaboration with another person to commit a violation of any section of the rules on academic misconduct. **Please note: In 325, generative AI tools such as ChatGPT are included in the definition of "person".**
- *Dual submission*: Submitting work that has been previously graded, or is being submitted concurrently to more than one course, without authorization from the instructor of the class to which the student wishes to submit. (This especially applies to those who are repeating MTH 225.)
- *Plagiarism*: Appropriation of, buying, receiving as a gift, or obtaining by any means material that is attributable in whole or in part to another source without any indication or citation of the original source, including words, sentences, ideas, illustrations, structure, computer code, and other expression or media, and presenting that material as one’s own academic work being offered for credit or in conjunction with a program, course, or degree requirements.

Please note that this is not a complete list; and note that the Student Code considers **enabling others** to engage in academic misconduct to be another form of academic misconduct.

What this looks like in MTH 325 is the following: 

- *On exams (Learning Target and Application/Analysis):* No collaboration with a person or technological resource is allowed, and no notes are allowed. You are allowed to use a basic, non-networked graphing or scientific calculator but smartphone use is not allowed, **including using a calculator app on a smartphone**. Please note there are no exceptions to the "no smartphone" rule, so be sure to acquire a simple hand calculator for use in the class and bring it with you to every exam. 
- *On other assignments*: Every other assignment in the class just earns engagement credits, and there are many ways to earn these. On these, your work must reflect your ideas and must be written in your voice. Significant copying from another student or from an electronic resource will be investigated as academic dishonesty. Otherwise you are allowed to use other people and tech tools as long as the purpose is learning. 

Academic misconduct is a serious matter that carries stiff penalties from the university. If I suspect that an item of work breaks the "your ideas/your voice" rule, I will first discuss it with the student turning the work in. If I determine that there was academic misconduct, the matter will go to the [Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution](https://www.gvsu.edu/osccr/) which has a process for handling these issues. The penalties can be quite severe, in some cases resulting in failure of the course or even suspension from the university. 

## The use of AI tools 

Generative AI tools offer an unparalleled ability to enhance and accelerate real learning that takes place in your (human) brain. For example, you can use AI tools to: 

- Generate practice problems apart from the ones on the weekly practices, and check your work
- Enlist an AI as a tutor or learning partner (for example [in "Guided Learning" mode in Gemini](https://www.theverge.com/news/732182/google-gemini-ai-guided-learning-education))
- Get alternate explanations for concepts in addition to the ones in the video lessons
- Use something like [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) to create an AI powered study guide for MTH 325

When used to supplement and extend your own efforts to learn, AI is great. **But when it is used to *replace* those efforts or find shortcuts around them, it gets bad**. 

In order to learn anything for mastery, you must plan on putting in many hours of hard work, in what is called "desirable difficulty". The difficulty you experience is a sign that you are doing it right. The lack of difficulty, or seeking to get around it, tells you that your'e doing things wrong. An over-reliance on AI tools in MTH 225 will become obvious very quickly: You will be lost during class, clueless on exams, and buried under the burden of repeated reattempts. 

**Your best plan for success in MTH 325 is to keep AI in a box and use it only to supplement and extend what is already taking place through your own hard work**. This is also how you, a future computing professional, will make yourself indispensable on the job market and give you some long-term stability in a rapidly changing world. 

## How to get help in MTH 325

**Having issues or questions in MTH 325 is totally normal, and the smart thing to do if you're stuck is get help.** There are a few ways to do this: 

- The best way to get help is to **prepare for class and participate in class meetings actively**. This way you will get help from your classmates and also have the chance to ask me (Talbert) questions; plus, you already have the time blocked off on your calendar. 
- You can also come to **drop-in hours** where you can ask anything you need to, without needing an appointment, and get 1-on-1 assistance. 
- If you cannot make drop-in hours, you can **schedule an appointment** for a Zoom call. The link for appointment scheduling is at the beginning of this syllabus. 

For help with prerequisite concepts from MTH 225 or high school, consider visiting the Math Tutoring Center (http://gvsu.edu/tutoring/math/). Bring questions to any location about using technology, on methods and concepts, or on specific problems. All Math Center tutoring is free and available in person on both the Allendale and Pew campuses as well as on Discord.

## Other Course Policies

### Staying current with course updates 

Course announcements are sent out every Sunday morning via Blackboard, and contain an overview of the classes for the week, a list of assignments and due dates, and specific items to note. Other announcements might be sent during the week if needed. All Blackboard announcements will also be sent to your GVSU email. It is your responsibility to check and read these emails carefully each week and manage the information contained in them. 

The [Class Page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWiOifmBieQYdwgCST8vJBBfraYd3YZsztRM6bnH6d4/edit?usp=sharing) contains a summary of each class meeting, including links to slides and other materials, given in reverse chronological order (newest first). 

### Instructor availability and communication

Email ([talbertr@gvsu.edu](mailto:talbertr@gvsu.edu)) is the best way to reach me with a message outside of class meetings. Please **do not use Blackboard messaging to contact me** but use regular email instead. Messages sent through Blackboard do not notify me or give me a way of replying to the message, and I will not reply to any messages received through that medium. 

Regarding email: 
- I typically check email **twice per day**, once in the early morning and again in the late afternoon and leave email closed otherwise. 
- **If your message is sent during normal working hours and needs a response, it will receive one within 24 hours**, but it may not be immediate. If your message does not require a response, I will typically not reply to it; if you want a response, be sure to make this clear. 
- **I do not typically check email outside of normal working hours (8am-5pm) or on weekends.** If you send an email during those times, it might be longer than 24 hours before you get a response. 
- In particular, **emails sent after 5pm Friday and on weekends will not get a response until the following Monday.** If you need something before Monday, please take this into account and ask questions early.

Also please note that I work on campus Monday, Wednesday, and Friday but typically work from home on Tuesday and Thursday. 


### Attendance, late work, makeups, and remote instruction

**Attendance:** Regular class attendance has been shown to correlate more strongly with student success in the class than any other variable. You are urged, and expected, to attend every class meeting unless it is physically impossible or inadvisable. **Attendance at each class meeting not set aside for am exam (or reattempt or makeup), earns 1 engagement credit.**

**Absences from non-exam days:** You do not need an excuse or prior approval to miss a class unless it's an exam. A heads-up is appreciated but not necessary. You will not earn the engagement credit, but those can be made up in other ways. 

**Absences from exams:** If you are absent from an Application/Analysis Exam, there is a designated makeup date of Friday, April 17 for all such makeups. See above for more details. If you are absent from a Learning Target exam, no makeups are typically available; instead you will be asked to attempt or reattempt the Learning Targets from the exam you miss, on the next one. If you do this and still need additional reattempts later in the semester, we will discuss the matter then. 

**Making up other assignments:** There are no makeups allowed for other assignments. 

**Contingency plans for remote instruction:** In the event that we need to switch to remote instruction, class meetings will take place on Zoom, and the link will be shared in a course announcement and on the [Class Page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWiOifmBieQYdwgCST8vJBBfraYd3YZsztRM6bnH6d4/edit?usp=sharing). If that day happens to be an exam day, we'll reschedule the exam and the focus of the class meeting will be determined at that time. [Click here for the official university policy on remote instruction](https://www.gvsu.edu/provost/guidelines-for-course-delivery-in-the-event-of-253.htm). 

### Gender identity

If, for purposes of gender identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.

### Classroom and campus safety

I consider classroom and campus safety our shared responsibility. Please familiarize yourself with the classroom emergency placard, which contains important information that could prove useful should an emergency arise. Emergency situations could include a fire alarm, tornado warning, medical emergency, or hostile intruder, and our response might consist of evacuating MAK Hall in an orderly manner, moving as a group to a different location in the building, rendering assistance to a class member, or staying put and locking the classroom door. In all cases, I will provide clear instructions as to what you should do. Please make sure to have your primary mobile number listed in Banner so that you will automatically receive any campus alerts. Should you receive an emergency notification in class, notify me immediately.

**The professor reserves the right to adjust this syllabus as needed and will notify you of any changes through Blackboard announcements.**

## About the instructor 

I'm Robert Talbert, the professor for this course and a Professor in the Mathematics Department. I have been teaching college math courses in different places for almost 35 years, and at GVSU since 2011. I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu/) and a B.S. degree from [Tennessee Technological University](http://www.tntech.edu/). 

I was, at best, a thoroughly mediocre math student in school until my senior year of high school, when I had a teacher for Calculus who stopped trying to cram things into my head and instead showed me the basics, then backed off and let me work things out on my own, with support if I got stuck. Basically, this is how I teach today.

After spending my first two years of college as a Psychology major, I changed my major to math after a late-night dare from my roommate (long story) and, to my surprise, I fell in love with the subject. I ended up going to graduate school to work in an obscure area at the intersection of abstract algebra and geometry, which seemed like pointless fun at the time but now turns out to have [serious applications to data science](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.667963/full) and to [the design of programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory). I also discovered I loved teaching math to college students. So I went on to spend 14 years teaching in small liberal arts colleges before coming to GVSU in 2011.

Currently I teach a lot of MTH 225 and MTH 325, getting engineers and computer scientists to think like mathematicians. I also do research on making college teaching better; I recently [wrote a book](https://www.routledge.com/Grading-for-Growth-A-Guide-to-Alternative-Grading-Practices-that-Promote/Clark-Talbert/p/book/9781642673814) about the kinds of grading systems you see in this syllabus, and I'm working on the second edition of [my book about flipped classrooms in higher education](https://www.routledge.com/Flipped-Learning-A-Guide-for-Higher-Education-Faculty/Talbert/p/book/9781620364321) which I wrote 10 years ago. When nobody is looking, I am working on my data science skills, learning languages like [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/), and  [studying economics](https://mru.org/). 

I've been a bass guitar player for over 25 years and regularly perform live in the area with  different bands. You can learn more about my music activities at [my music website](https://rtgrooves.com/) or [my Linktree page](https://linktr.ee/rtgrooves). 

I live in Allendale with my wife and 17-year old son (who's interested in computer engineering). I have a daughter studying Marketing at [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/) and a 21-year old daughter who lives on her own. I love the outdoors and get out to walk or hike when I can. You can read more about what I'm thinking and doing at my website, [rtalbert.org](http://rtalbert.org), or [Grading for Growth](https://gradingforgrowth.com/) about alternative grading practices which I co-author with my GVSU colleague Prof. David Clark. I'm also on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roberttalbert/). I will accept any connection request on LinkedIn from a student!
