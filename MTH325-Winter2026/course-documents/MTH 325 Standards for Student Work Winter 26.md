# Standards for Student Work in MTH 325

## About this document

**This document contains all the details of what you will be asked to do on different assessments in the course, and what constitutes "successful" work on each task**. You should consider this document to be of equal importance as the [Syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH325-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20325%20W26%20syllabus.md) and [calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=fce0ab714102f433750e60ad2eefaaa2a9bd6d972a471eb2f16bc1ce75972063%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FDetroit) in terms of guiding your progress in the course. Study it carefully and refer to it each time before submitting an assignment, to ensure you're giving your best effort. 

## Ground Rules for all work in MTH 325

Unless otherwise stated on the assignment, every assignment in MTH 325 operates under the following guidelines: 

- **Your work is evaluated mainly on the quality of your reasoning and explanations, and only somewhat on the correctness of your answers**. Whenever you submit work that has a "final answer" it must be accompanied by an explanation of how you got it and why you think it's correct. Such explanations are generally a combination of English text and math. The English used must be clearly and simply stated. Grammatical correctness is less important, but excessive errors can make an explanation unclear. Mathematical work must be logically organized and legible. **Unless the item says otherwise, a response given without explanation will be not be considered correct or a good-faith effort at correctness.**
- **The target audience for your explanations is your classmates**. Your explanation should allow a person who has the same level of training and background as you -- but who has no familiarity with the problem you are solving -- to follow your solution from beginning to end and agree with your answer, without having to do much or any extra work and without accepting anything on faith. If your explanation skips steps; or simply asserts that something is true rather than explains why; or uses language that is unclear or hard to follow; or is disorganized or illogical; or other such things, it will probably not meet the standards. 
- **Solutions to problems should generally be free of any significant errors, and you should try to submit work that is totally free of these.** The next section below goes into detail about what is considered an "error". On the other hand, minor errors are typically ignored as long as there are not too many of them. The next section explains what a "minor error" is and gives examples. 

## What is an "error" and what is a "minor error" 

The fundamental question that drives my grading is: **Does the student's work show clear and sufficient evidence that they have mastered the core concepts and processes that the assignment focuses on?** Solutions that do provide this evidence are usually successful (even if there are small things wrong with them). But solutions that include items that cast doubt on your mastery will likely not be. 

Therefore your goal in every item of work you submit for a grade is to **provide this clear and sufficient evidence that you have mastered the content**, in the form of **clear, correct, and complete solutions** as described above. 

Note that **this goes beyond simply having "right answers" or "wrong answers"**. Sometimes a wrong answer to a problem might be wrong for reasons unrelated to the core ideas of the problem, and your grasp of the core concepts is still evident. On the flip side, a solution might have a right answer but the means by which you got that right answer does not show evidence of mastery of the core concepts. And in some cases a problem may not even have a single right or wrong answer at all. 

There are four main kinds of errors that often lead to solutions that are not successful. You will hear these referred to by name: 

1. **Computational errors**. This is when you simply make a mistake in computing something, like adding $5+3$ and getting $9$. 
2. **Logical errors**. This is when you draw incorrect conclusions from data. For example, if you know that there are 10 computer science majors in a class and 5 math majors, and conclude that there are $10+5=15$ students that are either math or computer science majors -- this is a logical error because it doesn't take double-majors into account. (This is known as the [Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion](https://publish.obsidian.md/discretecs/Combinatorics/Principle+of+Inclusion+and+Exclusion) which you learned in MTH 225.)
3. **Factual errors**. This results from misstating or misusing definitions, theorems, steps of an algorithm, or parameters in a problem statement. For example, misstating a formula is a factual error, even if you perform a computation with it and the result is mathematically correct.  Or, if a problem states that there are 100 objects that need to be sorted but you mis-copy the problem and write down 10 objects instead, that's a factual error. **Many errors in MTH 325 result from incorrectly reading or copying down information. These errors are easy to avoid, simply by slowing down and double-checking your steps.**
4. **Semantic errors**. This happens when you make a statement that is grammatically correct, but the statement itself has no meaning. For example the statement "*MTH 325 is a very purple unicorn*" obeys the rules of the English language, but it makes no sense. The same is true of the statement, "*The function of the set is 3*" because the phrase "the function of the set" has no meaning (there is no such thing). Semantic errors can be hard for those learning the subject to catch before making them. They will be politely pointed out in your feedback to help you spot and correct them. 

Along with these four kinds of errors, are two levels of severity: "significant" or "minor": 

- A **significant** error is one that pertains directly to the core concepts of the problem or assignment and calls your understanding and mastery of those concepts into question. 
- A **minor** error is one that does not pertain directly to the core concepts of the problem or assignment, and your understanding and master of those concepts is still evident despite the error. 

Whether an error is significant or minor, depends a lot on context and is at my (Talbert's) discretion to decide. Any time an error happens, of any kind of level of seriousness, it will be pointed out in the feedback you receive from me, and typically you will get a chance to correct it (see ["Reattempts of Assessments" un your syllabus](https://github.com/RobertTalbert/discretecs/blob/master/MTH225-Winter2026/course-documents/MTH%20225%20W26%20syllabus.md#reattempts-of-assessments).)


## Standards for assignments in MTH 325 

Below are the criteria that I (Talbert) use to decide whether your work us "successful", by assignment type. 

### Engagement credit items

Items that earn engagement credits are graded on the basis of completeness and effort, with the full engagement credit amount awarded when the submission is **a good-faith effort at a complete submission, and submitted prior to its deadline** and no credit awarded otherwise. This means: 

- *The item must be turned in prior to the deadline*, not after. 
- *Each part of the item must have some response*. That is, you may not skip or omit parts of the item, and the item will not receive credit if parts are skipped or omitted, even if by accident; or if work on any one part is significantly incomplete. (Although, if a part is labeled "Optional" you can skip it.)
- *Each response must be a legitimate attempt to respond correctly to the prompt*. You may not, for example, submit "I don't know" as a response to a short-answer or long-form text question; or submit an emoji or randomly generated text. Items containing such responses will not receive credit. 

These criteria do not apply to class attendance. You will earn 1 engagement credit for attending a class meeting (other than an exam, reattempt session, or makeup session) for at least 30 minutes. 

### Application/Analysis Exams 

As explained in the Syllabus, the two Application/Analysis Exams will consist of four parts: A multiple-choice and true/false portion, and three groups of problems (where in each group you will select one problem to work from several offered). 

Application/Analysis Exams are graded **holistically**, which means that while individual items will be given feedback, the grade is given to the overall work on the exam. 

| Mark         | Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --- |
| *Master*     | Roughly 9/10 of the multiple choice and true/false items are correctly answered. The work from problem groups is done with no "significant" errors and no more than 3-5 "minor" errors overall                                                |     |
| *Proficient* | Roughly 7/10 of the multiple choice and true/false items are correctly answered. The work from problem groups contains no more than 3-5 "minor" errors overall, and no more than one of the problem groups can contain a "significant" error. |     |
| *Beginner*   | The criteria for *Proficient* are not met; or, if one or more Problem Groups have no significant attempts at a solution.                                                                                                                      |     |


The individual parts of each exam will also be marked and recorded on Blackboard to help you know which portions need to be reattempted later. But only the holistic, overall mark is considered for your course grade. 


### Learning Targets

As explained in the Syllabus, each Learning Target exam consists of one problem for each individual Learning Target that has been covered in the class up to that point. Each problem focuses *only* on the Learning Target it corresponds to. Subsequent exams will feature different versions of the same problems with the specific details changed. 

Below is a list of each Learning Target, what you can expect to be asked to do on its exam problem, and what constitutes a *Master* rating. A *Proficient* rating will be given for work that is mostly *Master* level but which has a few significant errors. A *Beginner* rating will be given for work that has more than a few significant errors. 

| Learning Target | Tasks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | *Master* means...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 1               | Given a mathematical proposition that is to be proved by mathematical induction: State the predicate involved in the proposition; state the value of the variable that corresponds to the base case; prove the base case; state the inductive hypothesis; and state the inductive step. (A completed proof is not necessary and will never be asked for.)                                                                                                                                                                                            | The predicate, inductive hypothesis, and inductive step must be correct and given in the same terms as the proposition. The base case must be fully proven with a brief but complete explanation. The following are considered to be minor errors and you are allowed at most one of these: Stating the wrong value of the variable for the base case (assuming that the base case holds with that wrong value; otherwise this is a significant error), not putting the words "Assume that.." or "Suppose that..." at the beginning of the inductive hypothesis, including a quantifier with the predicate when asked for the predicate, and using a universal quantifier instead of existential in the inductive hypothesis ("For all integers $k$" instead of "For some integer $k$"). |
| 2               | Given a mathematical proposition that is to be proved and which is in the form of a conditional statement: State the assumptions that would be made for a direct contrapositive or indirect proof. Then state what would need to be proven for a direct or contrapositive proof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | All five items being asked for (the three assumptions and the two statements of what need to be proven) are correctly and clearly stated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3               | Given a graph, state information about it, including but not necessarily limited to: the number of vertices and edges, the degree of each vertex, the degree sequence of the graph, the minimum and maximum degree of the graph, the vertices that are adjacent to a given vertex, the existence of paths or cycles with a given length. Also, draw visual representations of named graphs, including, but not limited to:  complete graphs, bipartite graphs, path graphs, and cycle graphs.                                                        | Most, if not all, of the information requested from the given graph is correct and clearly stated. Note that the graph may not appear in a visual format, but might instead be given as an edge list, dictionary, or other alternative representations. All requested drawings of named graphs are legibly drawn and are correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 5               | Given a graph, determine whether it has an Euler path, Euler circuit, Hamiltonian path, and/or Hamiltonian circuit, and explain your reasoning. If the graph does have a path or circuit of the appropriate type, state what that path or circuit is by giving a vertex list. If it does not, cite an appropriate theorem and explain why the conditions of the theorem are satisfied. (You will be asked to address each of these four structures as to whether the graph has it or not.)                                                           | Each answer, yes or no, as to whether the structure exists is correct. And each answer has a clear and correct explanation for why the structure exists or doesn't exist. Please note, the graph you receive may not be in a visual format, but could be in one of another representation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 6               | Given a tree with labeled nodes and a root identified, state information about the tree, including but not limited to the following: The root, parent-child relationships among the nodes, leaves, the internal nodes, the siblings of a given parent, the level or depth of a node, the height of the tree, and the existence of subtrees. Then give an ordered list of nodes obtained by one or more of the following traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder.                                                                                    | Most, if not all, of the information requested from the given graph is correct and clearly stated. Each traversal requested has all or nearly all of the nodes correctly stated and in the correct order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 7               | Given an unweighted graph with labeled nodes, perform both a depth-first search and breadth-first search on it, starting at a given vertex, and for both search types, state both a list of the visited vertices in the order in which they are visited and a history of the stack or queue used to implement the search. Given a weighted graph, implement Dijkstra's algorithm, as we will discuss in class, using the format that we use in class, to construct a minimum distance spanning tree. Give the spanning tree as a list of edges.      | Both the list of vertices given in order and the stack or queue history are legible and present in the solution. The stack or queue history may contain a small number of minor errors. If they do, then the list of visited vertices must be consistent with the stack/queue history that is presented in the solution.For Dijkstra's algorithm, the solution contains both the spanning tree as a list of edges, as well as a completed history of the updated distances that would be obtained through the classroom implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. A small number of minor errors is allowed, but the edge list must be consistent with the errors.                                                                                                                         |
| 8               | Given a weighted graph, implement both Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm to find minimum spanning trees. State the minimum spanning tree resulting from each algorithm as an edge list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | You will only be asked to submit the edge list for the results of these algorithms. If you include work or explanations, then that work will be taken into account if there are small numbers of minor errors. Otherwise, any mistakes will result in not receiving a *Master* rating.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 9               | Given an unweighted graph with labeled nodes, implement the greedy algorithm to obtain a valid vertex coloring for the graph. State the result in coloring as a Python dictionary. Then determine the chromatic number of the graph by direct demonstration and/or by use of theorems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | The coloring is correctly stated as a Python dictionary and work or explanation is given to show how the dictionary was created. The chromatic number is also correctly stated and is justified by use of direct demonstration and appropriate application of theorems; That explanation is clearly stated in the solution in English.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 10              | Given a directed graph, state information about it, including but not limited to the following: The in-degree and out-degree of a given vertex, the source and sink vertices, predecessors and successors of a given vertex, whether a given vertex is reachable from another vertex, and whether it is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Then convert the given directed graph into at least two other representations, including, but not necessarily limited to, visual pictures, directed edge lists, Python dictionaries, and adjacency matrices. | Most, if not all, of the information requested from the given graph is correct and clearly stated. Note that the graph may not appear in a visual format, but might instead be given as an edge list, dictionary, or other alternative representations. The graph, when converted to all of the other representations requested, is correct and is the same graph as the original.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 11              | Given a relation represented as a directed graph in a specific form, state whether the relation is reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and/or antisymmetric. You will be asked to address all four of those properties. If the graph fails to have a property, provide a specific counterexample that explains why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Each of the four responses as to whether the relation has or does not have the given property must be correct. Properties that fail to hold in the graph must be accompanied by a specific concrete counterexample that shows why. Properties that do hold in the graph do not need to be explained, but they must be correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 12              | Given a directed graph in a specific representation, complete several rows in the process of Warshall's algorithm. You will be given information for at least two of the initial rows. Then draw the directed graph that represents the transitive closure of the original.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | In the table for Warshall's algorithm, the information must be given in bits, zeros and ones, and must be correct up to a small number of minor errors. If minor errors occur, then subsequent rows must be consistent with the errors. The drawing of the transitive closure must be completely correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
