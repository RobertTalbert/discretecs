    "+ According to the [Specifications for Student Work in MTH 325 document](https://gist.github.com/RobertTalbert/641c29bd9f3fc60cba93), you are to write your submission up as a Jupyter notebook using an appropriate mix of text, math, and code. Save your Jupyter notebook to your shared Dropbox folder using the file name `LastName-Miniproject1` where `LastName` is replaced by your last name (family name). \n",
    "+ Please save a _second_ copy of this assignment as an HTML file with the same name (`LastName-Miniproject1`). If you are working in SageMath Cloud, you can save a Jupyter notebook as HTML by going to `File` then `Download As` and then `HTML (.html)`. \n",
