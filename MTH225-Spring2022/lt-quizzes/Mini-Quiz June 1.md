# Mini-Quiz June 1

:::info
This is a **mini-quiz**, designed to give you an attempt at **a small number of Learning Targets** of your choice from among the more recent ones we've covered, especially CORE targets, done **quickly** and **in class**. 

This mini-quiz contains problems for **Learning Targets 7, 13, and 14**. You may do any combination of these you want. Or if you prefer to practice some more and try again this week, do nothing and just take the main Quiz on Thursday. 


Work the problems you select out on paper or in a notes app, export the work to PDF (one PDF per Learning Target) and upload it to the appropriate assignment folder on Blackboard just as in the case of a full Quiz. 

**Your work is due by 2:30pm.** No submissions will be accepted after that time.

## Learning Target 7

:::warning
(**CORE**) I can write a set using roster and set-builder notation. 
:::

1. Write each of the following sets in correct roster notation: 
   (a) $\{n \, \% \, 10 \, : \, n \in \mathbb{N} \}$
   (b) $\{ x \in \mathbb{N} \, : \, x \, \% \, 10 = 5 \}$ 

2. Write the following sets in set-builder notation. There may be more than one correct way to do it. Your answer must restate set membership in some way. (*See below*)
   (a) $\{-2, 0, 2 \}$
   (b) $\{2, 5, 8, 11, 14\}$
   
3. Consider the sets: 
$$\begin{array} 
AA &= \{r,s,t\} \\
B &= \{t,u,v\} \\
C &= \{r,s,t,u,v,w\} \\
D &= \{v,x,y\}
\end{array}
$$
For each statement below, state whether the statement is True or whether it is False. 
   (a) $A \in C$
   (b) $A \subseteq C$
   (c) $x \in C$
   (d) $\emptyset \subseteq A$ 
   (e) $D \subseteq D$ 
 
:::info
*What "restate set membership in some way" means*: If your set is called $A$, you cannot "rewrite" $A$ as 
$$A = \{ x \, : \, x \in A\}$$
For example if $A = \{0,1\}$, then the set-builder form of $A$ cannot be given as $\{ x \, : \, x \in \{0,1\}\}$. (It's correct, but trivial.) Instead restate set membership in some way, for example
$$A = \{ x \% 2 \, : \, x \in \mathbb{N} \}$$
This is not only correct but uses set-builder notation in a nontrivial way.
:::
 
**Success criteria:** At least 3 of the 4 answers in the first two items are correct, and no more than two simple errors are present. All answers in the third item are correct. 

## Learning Target 13

:::warning
(**CORE**) I can apply the Additive and Multiplicative Principles and the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion to formulate and solve basic combinatorics problems. 
:::

*Work out the answer to each of the counting questions below. State the answer clearly, and show all work and explain your reasoning in words on each. **Note:** Answers with insufficient explanations or work are not accepted.* 

Student ID numbers at South Michigan State University consist of two letters (selected from A through Z) followed by six digits (selected from 0 through 9). How many possible ID numbers are there...

1. In all? 
2. In all, if no repetitions of the letters are allowed (but repetition of numbers is allowed)? 
3. In all, if repetition of the letters and digits is allowed, but the final digit must be an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, or 8)? 


**Success criteria:** All three parts have good-faith efforts at a correct answer and contain clear, substantive explanations that justify the approach and answer. At least two of the three answers
must be correct and sufficiently justified; the third may be incorrect as long as it results from a "simple" error. 


## :new: Learning Target 14 

:::warning
(**CORE**) I can compute a binomial coefficient and apply the binomial coefficient to solve basic combinatorics problems. 
:::

1. Compute the exact numerical value of the following. Either show work or explain in one sentence how you got your answer. Leave no fractions in your answers. 
   (a) $\binom{15}{10}$
   (b) $\binom{100}{0}$
   (c) $\binom{100}{1}$
   
2. Solve the following counting problems. State your answer clearly and justify each answer with math work or a brief verbal explanation. The justification for each answer must involve the binomial coefficient. 
   (a) How many subsets of the set $\{a,b,c,d,e,f\}$ are there that have *exactly two* elements? 
   (b) A class with 14 students is selected for a research study, and 6 students will be selected at random from it to form an experimental group. How many ways are there to make this selection? 
   
**Success criteria:** All three of the answers on the first item are correct and have sufficient justifications. Both parts of the second item have good-faith efforts at a correct answer and contain clear, substantive explanations that justify the approach and answer. At least one of the two answers must be correct and sufficiently justified; the other may be incorrect as long as it results from a "simple" error.
