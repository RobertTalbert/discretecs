# Learning Target Quiz 1

:::info

This is your first Learning Target quiz! This quiz contains questions for **Learning Targets 1 and 2**. 

* It's to your advantage to attempt as many problems as possible. But you *do not* need to attempt all the problems. Only attempt the ones you believe you are ready to take. 
* Do your work on separate pages with **each Learning Target on its own separate page**. *Please do not put multiple Learning Targets on the same page.* 
* Make sure to consult the [Standards for Assessments in MTH 225](/KoT83ezHRYO3DqPyXMMMag) document before starting on your work, so you're clear on what is expected and what constitutes a "successful" attempt. 
* When you are done: **Scan** each Learning Target to a clear, legible, black-and-white PDF and **upload the PDF** to the designated folder on Blackboard. Remember *do not just take a picture with your camera* --- use a scanning app to create a PDF, and upload the PDF.
