## Instructions

This assignment is designed to get you up and running on the basic setup of MTH 225 and to provide me with information that will help me help you learn. Each part is in a separate section, below. This assignment doesn't have a grade attached, but each part has criteria for successful completion. **Please complete all parts successfully no later than 11:59pm Eastern on Tuesday, September 7.** While there's no grade, there are rewards and penalties: 

- If you complete all parts successfully before the deadline, you will **earn a token** that you can spend in any way outlined in the syllabus. 
- If you *do not* complete all parts successfully before the deadline, you will be given an additional day to finish up, and then you will **lose one token for every day after September 8 that the assignment is incomplete** until your token count is zero. 

You *do not* need to do the parts below in order. Just complete them all successfully by the deadline.

This quiz consists of 20 multiple-choice questions about the syllabus and calendar.

Once you have joined, click on "Class Feed" and look for the post titled "Welcome!". The link to that thread is https://campuswire.com/c/GB1A69E25/feed/1 Open this, and **leave a reply** that gives the following information:

## Part 3: Practice with scanning and uploading PDFs

Your work on Weekly Challenges will involve uploading PDFs of your work to Blackboard for grading. Many students choose to hand-write their work on paper, then scan it to PDF, and upload it. This is simple but not effortless, and I've prepared a short tutorial on how to do this: 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P6ShKUzlmMEMLxJc-EpxyRT2HELK-0KriZqDdWqstdk/edit

I want all student to practice this workflow before Weekly Challenges begin. Here are the instructions: 

1. On paper or a whiteboard, write or draw something. If you need inspiration, use the quadratic formula to solve $3x^2 + 4x + 1 = 0$. Or hand-copy the Declaration of Independence, or something. The content doesn't matter; just write it out in an analog medium, just like you might hand-write your Weekly Challenges. 
2. Using a scanning app on your phone and the instructions in the tutorial linked above, scan your work to a legible, black-and-white PDF. **Do not just take a photo with your camera.** The reasons for that are explained in the tutorial. 
3. Save the PDF. Then go to Blackboard to the *START HERE* area and locate the Assignment titled "PDF upload practice". Click the link and follow the instructions from the tutorial to submit your PDF. 

:::info
**To successfully complete this part:** Submit the black-and-white PDF in the designated place on Blackboard. Once it's submitted, there will be a Blackboard gradebook item for it. I will put either a "0" or a "1" in that item; "1" indicates that everything was done successfully, and "0" means there was an issue --- check the submission for feedback and information. **Again: The file format must be PDF. Graphics files in JPG or PNG format will not be accepted.**
