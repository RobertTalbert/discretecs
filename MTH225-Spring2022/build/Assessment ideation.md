# Ideating the assessment scheme for 225

Skills based learning targets
- Regular quizzing: At least weekly. Require two successful demonstrations. 
- Alternatives to quizzing: Presentation in class; live oral quiz via appointment or drop in hours. 


Problems
- These are like AEPs, in fact I might call them that
- Fewer in number and fewer required; maybe only 1 for a C
- Graded EMRN
- Assign in batches -- as many as possible in weeks 1-2
- Can submit two things a week -- Two new submissions, two revisions, or one of each 
- Use to satisfy "problem solving" standards 

Final exam:
- Could just be a final reattempt of Learning Targets
- Or put up something more summative, perhaps using Blackboard and multiple-choice questions? Require 60% for A, 50% for B, etc. 

Daily Prep 
- Completeness and effort 
- Maybe use Perusall? 
- Answering basic reading/viewing questions + doing simple exercises
- Completeness and effort only 

Something like a "Practice Portfolio"
- Students work on applying the concepts from the class to simple problems and explaining their work
- Assign weekly -- 5-10 problems each 
- Turn in on Blackboard
- Graded Pass/Revise based on full correctness 

**Never mind on the above**, that is way too much grading. Instead, electronic homework practice. 
- Weekly sets of 10-12 problems automatically graded
- Require a reasonable number of these completed each week
- Time allowed in class for practice and questions
- *Use WeBWorK* and use excerpts from WW in weekly quizzes. 

**The idea here is that the class will be "truly flipped" with the vast majority of assessed work taking place *during* the synchronous meetings, and most out of class stuff is just reading, viewing, asking questions.** 

## First pass at the grade construction

Course grade is based on: 
- Daily Prep completion
- Weekly practice completion
- Number of Learning Targets mastered -- split into core and non-core
- Number of AEPs completed at passing level or above
- Final exam
