# Ideating class activities 

## General thoughts 

- Each class is 1:00-3:15 which is 135 minutes long. 
- Structure into pomodoros:  
  - 1:00-1:25, then a break -- For review and q/a on preclass work 
  - 1:30-1:55, then a break -- For focused group work where we're all working on the same thing 
  - 2:00-2:25, then a break -- Continuation of P3
  - 2:30-3:00, then a break -- For continued work, or stations, or online homework 
  - 3:00-3:15 for wrapping up and metacognition  
- Unless we take a pomorodo for assessments: 
  - 1:00-1:25, then a break -- For review and q/a on preclass work 
  - 1:30-1:55, then a break -- For focused group work where we're all working on the same thing
  - 2:00-2:25, then a break -- For continued work, or stations, or online homework 
  - 2:30-2:45 for wrap-up/metacognition
  - 2:45-3:15 assessment
- Focus each day on one, maybe two learning targets and practice 
- What needs to happen each day: 
  - Warmup and review, q/a on new material (pomodoro 1)
  - Practice on new material -- all focus on new content (pomodoro 2+3)
  - Free time for practice on whatever -- split into stations (pomodoro 4) 
  - Replace station practice with assessment on assessment days 

## Class activities

- For warmup and review, polling activities (PollEverywhere) 
- Pomodoro 2 activities: Students doing focused work in working groups -- problems on Jamboard (or whatever) then debrief and present 
- All activities have these in common: 
  - They look like/instantiate the Learning Target quizzes *or* build up some significant piece of an AEP *or* they result in some cool discovery *or* illustration of an important point 
  - They are done either collaboratively, or first individually and then collaboratively
  - The work is made visible by doing it on a board or in a Google Doc (and curated in an ongoing Class Page)
  - They end result is made available for questions and is saved for later reference 
  - Students reflect on what they are doing
