## Part B -- Mathematical Induction

**Reminder:** The *framework* for an induction proof consists of three things: 
1. A verification of the base case 
2. A statement of the inductive hypothesis
3. A statement of the inductive step

It also helps to have a clear statement of the predicate involved. 

### Option 1

The predicate here is

$$P(n):  3^n < n!$$

**Verification of base case:** The base case is when $n = 7$. We want to show $P(7)$ is true -- in other words we want to verify that $3^7 < 7!$. We can do this by computing the left and right sides directly: $3^7 = 2187$ and $7! = 5050$. We can see that $2187 < 5040$ so the base case is verified. 

**Inductive hypothesis:** Assume that for some $k$, $3^k < k!$. 

**Inductive step:** Prove that $3^{k+1} < (k+1)!$ 

**Analysis of the proposed proof:** The proposed proof has a flaw in its logic that makes it inroc
