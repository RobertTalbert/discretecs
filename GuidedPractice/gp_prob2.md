# MTH 225 Guided Practice Probability 2: The theory of probability 

## Overview

Having learned about the basics of probability and how to compute simple probabilities, we will look at some of the underlying rules for working with probabilities in this lesson. We first look at two essential conditions for probability to make sense and then look at how these rules apply to finding probabilities of combinations of events. Finally we introduce the idea of _conditional probability_ which is the probability of an event occurring, given that a related event has already occurred. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

+ State the two conditions necessary to assign probabilities to a set of events. 
+ Given a set of events, define a _probability distribution_ on that set that obeys the two basic conditions.
+ Find the probability of an event by using the probabilities of its outcomes. 
+ Find the probability of a collection of pairwise disjoint events. 
+ Given events E and F, find the conditional probability of E given F. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Determine whether two events are _independent_. 
+ Solve applied probability questions arising from randomized algorithms and games of chance by applying the basic rules of probability. 

## Learning resources 

Note: For this and all other lessons in the probability unit, we will be using Chapter 6 from _Discrete Mathematics and its Applications_, sixth edition by Kenneth Rosen. A PDF of this chapter is available at the Blackboard site in the __Textbook and software__ section. However, for your reading, I am using your class to beta-test a new software service called __Perusall__ that will allow you to access the chapters of the book and engage in a threaded discussion about its contents. You can access the materials at Perusall by doing the following: 

+ Go to [http://app.perusall.com](http://app.perusall.com) and create a free account. 
+ Then enter in the access code `TALBERT-9528` to enroll in the MTH 225 course that has been set up. 
+ Look for the __Discrete probability 6.2__ document that has been set up for you, and open it up. _Read up to, but not past, the subsection on "Bernoulli Trials and the Binomial Distribution" on page 406._ 
+ As you read through the text, you can add annotations to the text and ask questions, and all other students in the course (including the other MTH 225 section) can read your questions and comment and provide their thoughts. 
+ Perusall uses machine learning to score your questions and comments and provide me with a synopsis of the discussion and a provisional grade for your work. __I will be monitoring these grades and the results may be used to provide students with additional Learning Community credits.__ 

Please look for a brief video introduction to Perusall and more information coming your way soon. Also realize that __the use of Perusall is optional, and if it gives you trouble, then just use the PDF at the Blackboard site__. 

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

Suppose that you are at a party and trying to perform a trick of guessing people's birthdays. (It's a boring party.) Suppose you have reason to believe that the probability of someone at the party being born in January is 0.07; of being born in February is 0.08; March, 0.09; April, 0.1; May, 0.12, June, 0.14; July, 0.13; and the probabilities of being born in any of the remaining months are equal. _Use these month probabilities in all the questions below; and assume that although the months may have different probabilities, the individual days within each month are all equally likely for being born on those days._

1. What is the probability that a person at the party was born in October? 
2. What is the probability that a person at the party was born in the summertime, which we will define to be June, July, and August? 
3. What is the probability that a person at the party was not born in December? 
4. What is the probability that a person at the party was born either in the summer or in an even-numbered month (February, April, June, August, October, December)? 
5. What is the probability that a person was born in an even-numbered month, if it's known that they were born in the summer? 
6. What is the probability that a person was born on the 31st day of the month, if it's known that they were both in an even-numbered month? 

## Submission instructions

Submit your responses using the form at this link: [http://bit.ly/1WIGt76](http://bit.ly/1WIGt76)

Note that although you can provide specific mathematical questions as always on this form, you're encouraged to use Perusall to ask questions because you might get more immediate help from classmates this way.
