<h1 id="mth-225-guided-practice-2.4-combinations-and-the-binomial-theorem">MTH 225 Guided Practice 2.4: Combinations and the Binomial Theorem</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We've almost assembled a complete suite of mathematical tools for working with counting problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Rule of Products</em> to help with counting arrangements given by a sequence of independent choices.</li>
<li><em>Permutations</em> to help with arrangements of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> objects in order, taken from a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> objects.</li>
<li><em>Set partitions</em> and the <em>Rules for Inclusion-Exclusion</em> to help with counting arrangements given by counting subsets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just one distinct kind of problem remains for us: What if we wanted to count the number of ways to arrange <span class="math">\(k\)</span> objects taken from a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> objects but <em>didn't</em> care about the order? The resulting idea is called a <em>combination</em> and we will learn about these, and a powerful related idea called the <em>Binomial Theorem</em> in this lesson.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the number of combinations of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> items taken from a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> items.</li>
<li>Calculate the binomial coefficient <span class="math">\(\binom{n}{k}\)</span> for given values of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the Binomial Theorem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the Binomial Theorem to find a given term of a binomial expression.</li>
<li>Count the items in an arrangement using an appropriate combination of counting rules.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>This time there is just a little bit of reading to do. Namely: Read in <em>ADS</em> section 2.4 -- or on Google -- the definition of the <em>binomial coefficient</em>, which is denoted by <span class="math">\(\binom{n}{k}\)</span>. Also read the statement of the <em>Binomial Theorem</em> (which again is in your book, or you can Google it) and reflect on what the theorem is telling you. For review: A &quot;theorem&quot; is a mathematical statement that has been proven to be true for all cases that satisfy the condition of the statement. (For example, the Binomial Theorem is an equation that is supposed to hold true for all integers <span class="math">\(n \geq 0\)</span> and for all real numbers <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> -- that's the &quot;condition&quot;.)</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Compute the values of <span class="math">\(\binom{4}{3}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\binom{4}{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>On a separate piece of scratch paper, write down all the ways to make a three-letter string out of the letters a, b, c, d, without repeating any letter. For example: <code>cdb</code>, <code>adc</code> are OK but not <code>aac</code>. You should end up with 24 of these strings. (Think: How could you have known that without listing them?) Now on your list, use a colored pen or highlighter to color/highlight two strings the same color if they have the same letters in them. For example <code>adc</code> and <code>cda</code> would be colored the same, but <code>adc</code> and <code>adb</code> would be colored differently. How many colors do you need?</li>
<li>Explain how the previous question and its answer would change if you were making two-letter strings instead of three-letter strings. (All other parameters of the question are the same.)</li>
<li>What does the first exercise in this assignment have to do with the second and third questions?</li>
</ol>
