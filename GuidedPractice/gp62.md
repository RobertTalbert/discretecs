# MTH 325 Guided Practice 6.2: Graphs of Relations on a Set

## Overview

In our first lesson we learned about _relations_ and their potential uses. We _represented_ relations from a set $A$ to a set $B$ in three different ways: as a subset of $A \times B$ (i.e., set of ordered pairs), as a verbal description (i.e. describing in words how to know when $(a,b)$ belongs to the relation), and as a schematic diagram. In this lesson we learn an important and useful way to represent relations, namely as _directed graphs_ in which points in our base set are represented as nodes, and relations between points are indicated by arrows. This is useful in its own right and also serves as foreshadowing for future material on Graphs coming up later in the course. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

+ Given a relation on a set $A$ represented as a directed graph, represent it as a set of pairs or a schematic diagram. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Given a relation on a set $A$ represented as a set of pairs, schematic diagram, or verbal description, draw a directed graph that represents the relation. 
+ Use a directed graph for a relation to determine information about that relation. 

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Applied Discrete Structures_, read Section 6.2. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch this video: 

+ [Proof and Problem Solving -- Relations 04](https://youtu.be/B4FGov67VhQ) Running time is 5:40 but you can stop at 2:05. -- This is an example of taking a directed graph and writing it as a set of pairs. 

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

1. Consider the relation on the set $A = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ given by the following directed graph:

(Direct link: [http://www.screencast.com/t/MWqRXGpYPab](http://www.screencast.com/t/MWqRXGpYPab))  Write this relation as a subset of $A \times A$, that is, as a set of ordered pairs. Be sure to use correct set notation. 

2. Consider the relation on the set $B = \{1, 2, 3, \dots, 20\}$ given by the following directed graph. Note that in this graph, each vertex has a _loop_ on it -- an edge that points from the vertex to itsef, even though the arrowhead is not visible on the loops.

At the submission form, you are asked to decide which relation this graph represents. Choose the answer that is most correct.

There is a final item at the response form that solicits any specific mathematical questions or comments you may have about the material in the reading or viewing. If you have any specific mathematical questions, leave them in the blank. Frequently occurring questions will be addressed during the discussion time in class. Other questions (good but not frequently occurring) will be replied to in person on through email. If you have no questions, just leave that item blank.
