<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-7.2a-injective-and-surjective-functions">MTH 325 Guided Practice 7.2a: Injective and Surjective Functions</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In the last lesson, we introduced the concept of the <em>function</em> and its basic rules and terminology. In the next two lessons we will look at specific kinds of functions, satisfying important properties pertaining to how they map elements from the domain to the codomain. These two lessons both come from Section 7.2 in <em>ADS</em>. In the next lesson we will examine <em>injective</em> and <em>surjective</em> functions, which are functions that satisfy rules about &quot;collisions&quot; (injective) and rules about &quot;coverage&quot; (surjective).</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether a given function is injective.</li>
<li>Determine whether a given function is surjective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give an example of a function that is surjective but not injective.</li>
<li>Give an example of a function that is injective but not surjective.</li>
<li>Give an example of a function that is neither injective nor surjective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>ADS</em>, read Section 7.2, just up through Example 7.2.6. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos. Again these are made for MTH 210, not MTH 325 so be aware of differences in notation and the way definitions are expressed.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/fGYaaKryZp4">Injective functions</a> (6:48)</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/jVniPMIexQE">Surjective functions</a> (9:02)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>Below are some functions. For each one, think carefully about it, and then at the response form indicate whether the function is injective, surjective, both, or neither.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><span class="math">\(A: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> given by <span class="math">\(A(x) = 3x + 2\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(B: \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> given by <span class="math">\(A(x) = 3x + 2\)</span>. (Careful -- this is not the same as the first function.)</li>
<li><span class="math">\(C: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\)</span> given by <span class="math">\(C(x) = x^3 - x\)</span>.</li>
<li><code>sum</code>, which is the function that takes a finite list of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. Example: <code>sum([1.1, 3, 5])</code> returns <code>9.1</code>. Assume that the domain is the set of all lists of real numbers; and the codomain is the set of real numbers.</li>
<li><code>first</code>, which is the function that takes a list of integers and returns the first element of the list. For example, <code>first([5,3,9])</code> returns <code>5</code>. The domain is the set of all lists of integers; the codomain is the set of all integers.</li>
<li>The function <code>tail</code> which taks a list of integers and returns all of the list except the first element. Example: <code>tail([1,2,3])</code> returns <code>[2,3]</code>. The domain and codomain are both the set of all lists of integers.</li>
<li>The function <code>reverse</code> which takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing the objects of the input list but in reverse order. Example: <code>reverse([3,1,4,1])</code> returns <code>[1,4,1,3]</code>. The domain and codomain are both the set of all lists of integers.</li>
