<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-9.2-data-structures-and-computer-generation-of-graphs">MTH 325 Guided Practice 9.2: Data structures and computer generation of graphs</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Having learned some basic terminology about graphs, we now turn our attention to how to represent graphs in a computer. There are many ways to do this! We will focus on representations that can be used in a broad variety of settings, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edge lists,</li>
<li>Adjacency matrices, and</li>
<li>Python dictionaries.</li>
</ul>
<p>You're actually familiar with much of this, since the Sage/Python structures for representing graphs are similar to those for representing directed graphs.</p>
<p>Also in this section we will learn how to use Sage for working with graphs, particularly how to define a graph in Sage, display it, and then use Sage built-in functions for finding out information about graphs.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). Note that important new terminology is given in italics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a visual or verbal description of a graph, write the graph as an edge list.</li>
<li>Given a visual or verbal description of a graph, write the adjacency matrix for the graph.</li>
<li>Given a visual or verbal description of a graph, write the graph as a Python dictionary.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a graph in any one format (dictionary, adjacency matrix, edge list) convert it to another format and draw a picture of it.</li>
<li>Use Sage to enter, visualize, and compute with graphs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>ADS</em>, read Section 9.2 as follows: First, read from the beginning of the section down to &quot;Mathematica Note&quot;. Then skip <em>all</em> of the &quot;Mathematica Note&quot;. Then read the &quot;Sage Note&quot; with SageMath Cloud up in front of you so you can type in the code (into a Sage worksheet).</p>
<p><strong>Sage Worksheet</strong>: I have prepared a Sage worksheet that discusses how graphs are entered, visualized, and computed with in Sage. This is posted as both a downloadable Sage worksheet and as a view-only PDF at the Guided Practice assignment. <em>Read this carefully and work with it</em> because knowledge of how to do basic work in Sage with graphs will be assumed after our class meeting is over.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>The following questions pertain to the undirected graph below:</p>
<p><img src="gp92-1.png"></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Represent this graph as an edge list, like you might type into Sage. Be sure to use correct syntax -- square brackets for lists, and ordered pairs for edges.</li>
<li>Represent this graph as a Python dictionary.</li>
<li>Write the adjacency matrix for this graph, using Sage/Python syntax for matrices. (That is, it should start with <code>Matrix([...</code> and then you enter in a list of lists. See the Sage worksheet for an example.)</li>
<li>If you were given the adjacency matrix for a graph, how would you find the degree of a vertex?</li>
</ol>
