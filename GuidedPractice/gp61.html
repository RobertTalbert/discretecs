<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-6.1-relations----basic-definitions">MTH 325 Guided Practice 6.1: Relations -- Basic Definitions</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We begin MTH 325 with an introduction to a powerful mathematical &quot;discrete structure&quot;: the <em>relation</em>. Relations are an abstracted means of expressing relationships between different sets of objects. You can think of them as databases -- in fact &quot;relational databases&quot; are built on the concept of the mathematical relation -- without the code. In this lesson we'll give a precise definition of what a relation is, learn how to express relations in three different ways (verbally, as a set, and as a schematic diagram), and discuss the <em>composition</em> of two relations.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a relation described verbally through a rule, write it as a set of ordered pairs.</li>
<li>Determine whether a given ordered pair belongs to a relation, and express this using correct notation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a relation described verbally or as a set of pairs, draw a diagram representing it.</li>
<li>Given a relation represented as a diagram, write it as a set of ordered pairs.</li>
<li>Given a relation <span class="math">\(r\)</span> from a set A to a set B, and another relation <span class="math">\(s\)</span> from B to a third set <span class="math">\(C\)</span>, express the composition <span class="math">\(rs\)</span> as a set of pairs or as a diagram.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>, read Section 6.1. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. Especially note the example preceding the definition of <em>composition</em> which shows how to compose two relations.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/h34hZ_hynzE">Discrete Math: Intro to Relations</a> <strong>only up to the 6:00 mark.</strong> Feel free to watch the rest, but we will not cover properties of relations until section 6.3. Also, the information on directed graphs actually belongs to section 6.2, but lots of students find this representation of relations helpful and easy to understand, so use that info as an early introduction to the next section.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Social networks like Facebook and Twitter are a great source of examples of relations. Let <span class="math">\(P\)</span> be the set of all accounts on Twitter. Define a relation <span class="math">\(t\)</span> on <span class="math">\(P\)</span> as follows: if <span class="math">\(x,y \in P\)</span> (that is, <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> are user accounts on Twitter), say that <span class="math">\(x \, t \, y\)</span> if and only if <span class="math">\(x\)</span> follows <span class="math">\(y\)</span> on Twitter. In the text box at the submission form, list five elements of this relation. If you are on Twitter, you can use yourself. If not, then pick a person on Twitter, go to their Twitter page (http://twitter.com/[username]) and click on &quot;Following&quot; to see who that person follows. Be sure to use correct mathematical notation in listing the elements of <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.</li>
<li>In the relation <span class="math">\(t\)</span> defined above, if <span class="math">\(x \, t \, y\)</span> then is it necessarily true that <span class="math">\(y \, t \, x\)</span>? Think about this in terms of how Twitter works and explain your reasoning.</li>
<li>Below is a schematic diagram for a subset of the relation <span class="math">\(t\)</span> defined above, for four users on Twitter. Call this relation <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now consider two copies of the diagram for <span class="math">\(r\)</span>:</p>

<p>(Direct links to each of these in case the images don't appear: <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/kXcUb5V5">http://www.screencast.com/t/kXcUb5V5</a> and <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/wK6htwGmjg9M">http://www.screencast.com/t/wK6htwGmjg9M</a>. )</p>
<p>At the submission form are several statements about these Twitter users and the relation <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. Check ALL the statements that are true. Leave all false statements unchecked.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is a final item at the response form that solicits any specific mathematical questions or comments you may have about the material in the reading or viewing. If you have any specific mathematical questions, leave them in the blank. Frequently occurring questions will be addressed during the discussion time in class. Other questions (good but not frequently occurring) will be replied to in person on through email. If you have no questions, just leave that item blank.</p>
