# MTH 325 Guided Practice 10.4: Binary trees

## Overview

This is the final lesson of the semester! First of all, give yourself a well-deserved pat on the back for getting almost to the end of the course. 

Our last concept we'll study is the notion of a _binary tree_ which has major importance in computer science. A binary tree is just a regular tree in which all of the internal vertices have 2 children or less. Binary trees are immensely useful in all sorts of algorithms and applications, and we will be looking at some of these now. The most important application is the notion of a _traversal_ of a tree, which refers to ways of visiting the vertices in a tree one by one to obtain a list of those vertices in a particular order. We'll look at three ways to traverse a tree (_inorder_, _preorder_, and _postorder_) and then apply those traversal methods to _binary search trees_ and _expression trees_.  

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). Note that important new terminology is given in italics. 

+ Determine whether a tree is binary or not. Also determine whether a binary tree is _full_ or not. 
+ For a binary tree, define and identify the left child, right child, left subtree, and right subtree at a given vertex.
+ Perform a postorder, preorder, and in order traversal of a binary tree.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Construct a binary search tree for a given list of sortable objects, then perform a binary search using the tree to find a particular object. 
+ Construct an expression tree for a given mathematical expression and use tree traversal to write the expression in prefix, infix, and postfix (reverse Polish) notation.

## Learning resources 

__Reading:__ Read Section 10.4 of your textbook up to but not including the section on "Counting Binary Trees". Note that there is an typo in Example 10.4.2 â€“ the third traversal result is for postorder, not preorder traversal. 

Also read the helpful [Wikipedia article on tree traversal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal), which includes picture examples.

Also try [this animation of binary tree traversals](http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/mukundan/dsal/BTree.html) (requires Java).

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

The exercises below refer to this tree:

1. At the submission form there is a multiple choice question that asks you to classify this tree. Answer that question. 
2. List the order in which the vertices would be visited using a _postorder_ traversal of this tree. 
3. List the order in which the vertices would be visited using a _preorder_ traversal of this tree. 
4. List the order in which the vertices would be visited using an _inorder_ traversal of this tree. 
5. State the right child of vertex 3. 
6. Give the left subtree located at vertex 3. Give the tree as a Python dictionary.
