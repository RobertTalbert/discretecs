<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-7.2b-bijective-functions-and-the-pigeonhole-principle">MTH 325 Guided Practice 7.2b: Bijective functions and the Pigeonhole Principle</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We've just learned about <em>injective functions</em> (functions with &quot;no collisions&quot;) and <em>surjective functions</em> (functions that &quot;cover everything&quot;). In this lesson we put these ideas together to examine <em>bijective</em> functions -- functions that are both injective and surjective -- and their uses. In particular we look at two applications of bijective functions: finding the cardinality of an infinite set, and the <em>Pigeonhole Principle</em>.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether a function is bijective.</li>
<li>State the Pigeonhole Principle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine whether a set is countable.</li>
<li>Use the Piegonhole Principle to solve counting and enumeration problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>For this section, don't do any reading or video watching because it spoils the surprise. The only thing you need to do is Google the following terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>The definition of a <em>bijective function</em>,</li>
<li>The definition of the <em>cardinality</em> of a set, and</li>
<li>A statement of the <em>Pigeonhole Principle</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How many people do you need to gather in a room before you can be certain that at least two people in the room were born on the same day of the week (Sunday, etc.)? State your answer and explain your reasoning.</li>
<li>Suppose you were given a function from the set <span class="math">\(\{1,2,3,4\}\)</span> to the set <span class="math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span>. Can this function possibly be injective? Why or why not? (Hint: There is a connection between this question and the first one.)</li>
<li>Consider the sets <span class="math">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> (the set of all integers) and the set <span class="math">\(\{0, \pm 3, \pm 6, \pm 9, \dots\}\)</span> (the set of all integer multiples of 3). Notice that the second set is a subset of the first one. Is it possible to have a bijection between these two sets? Explain why or why not.</li>
