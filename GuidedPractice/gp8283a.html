<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-8.28.3a-sequences-and-recurrence-relations">MTH 325 Guided Practice 8.2/8.3a: Sequences and Recurrence Relations</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In our previous lesson on recursion, we learned about recursion. (See what I did there?) One of our examples of recursion was the <em>Fibonacci sequence</em> which is an infinite list of integers that are defined using recursion. In this lesson, we will dig deeper into recursively-defined sequences and introduce a key mathematical tool for understanding them -- the <em>recurrence relation</em> and <em>solutions</em> to recurrence relations. By studying recurrence relations and their solutions, we'll be able to take sequences defined recursively and write them using a closed form expression.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a recursively defined sequence, generate several elements of the sequence.</li>
<li>Given a recurrence relation, identify its order.</li>
<li>Given an n-th order linear recurrence relation, identify its coefficients.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a recurrence relation and a proposed solution, determine if the proposed solution really is a solution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>ADS</em>, read Section 8.2 and 8.3 up through the subsection titled &quot;Recurrence Relations Obtained from 'Solutions'&quot;. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: No video this time.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>Consider the sequence <span class="math">\(S\)</span> defined by <span class="math">\(S(0) = 3\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S(1) = 11\)</span>, and the remaining terms of the sequence are defined by the recurrence relation <span class="math">\(S(k) = = 10 S(k-1) - 9 S(k-2)\)</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Determine the values of <span class="math">\(S(3)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(S(4)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(S(5)\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the order of the recurrence relation. (There's a multiple choice item for this.)</li>
<li>Consider the closed-form expression <span class="math">\(F(k) = 9^k + 2\)</span>. Find <span class="math">\(F(0), F(1), \dots, F(5)\)</span>. What does this suggest about the relationship between <span class="math">\(F(k)\)</span> and the recurrence relation for <span class="math">\(S(k)\)</span>?</li>
<li>Does the fact that <span class="math">\(F(k)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S(k)\)</span> match for the first six terms mean that <span class="math">\(F(k)\)</span> is a solution for the recurrence relation? Explain why or why not.</li>
