<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-8.3b-solving-linear-recurrence-relations">MTH 325 Guided Practice 8.3b: Solving Linear Recurrence Relations</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In the previous lesson, we learned about recurrence relations, what a solution to a recurrence relation looks like, and how to verify whether a given closed-form expression is or is not a solution to a recurrence relation. The next step is to <strong>find</strong> a closed form solution to a recurrence relation. We will do so using a technique that involves converting a recurrence relation into a polynomial (the <em>characteristic polynomial</em>) then using algebra to find its roots.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify when a recurrence relation is homogenenous versus non-homogeneous.</li>
<li>Write the characteristic polynomial and characteristic equation for a linear recurrence relation.</li>
<li>Find the roots of the characteristic polynomial: by hand in simple cases, and using a computer in more complicated cases.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a homogeneous linear recurrence relation, use Algorithm 8.3.1 to find a closed-form solution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>, read in Section 8.3 from the subsection ``Solving Recurrence Relations'' through Example 8.3.9. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. Warning: The book's exposition here is not clear!</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos:</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Consider the recurrence relation <span class="math">\(S(k) + S(k-1) - 12 S(k-2) = 0\)</span> with initial conditions <span class="math">\(S(0) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S(1) = 3\)</span>. Is this recurrence relation homogeneous? Explain why or why not.</li>
<li>Again consider the recurrence relation <span class="math">\(S(k) + S(k-1) - 12 S(k-2) = 0\)</span> with initial conditions <span class="math">\(S(0) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S(1) = 3\)</span>. Write the characteristic equation for this recurrence relation. (Use the caret symbol ^ for exponents in the submission form, for example 3^k.)</li>
<li>Again consider the recurrence relation <span class="math">\(S(k) + S(k-1) - 12 S(k-2) = 0\)</span> with initial conditions <span class="math">\(S(0) = 0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(S(1) = 3\)</span>. Find the solutions to the characteristic equation. Are they distinct or repeated?</li>
<li>Explain how you would proceed to find a closed-form solution to the original recurrence relation in question 1 given the information you have about the solutions to the characteristic equation.</li>
