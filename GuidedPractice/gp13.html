<h1 id="mth-225-guided-practice-1.3-cartesian-products-and-power-sets">MTH 225 Guided Practice 1.3: Cartesian Products and Power Sets</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In the last lesson we learned about <em>operations</em> that we can perform on sets (union, intersection, complement, and symmetric difference). In this lesson we focus on two more set operations that will be particularly important in later studies of discrete structures:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Cartesian product</em> of two sets, which is a way of forming a set of ordered pairs of elements; and</li>
<li>The <em>power set</em> of a set, which is a set containing all the subsets of the original set. (Did you get all that?)</li>
</ul>
<p>As before, we want to focus not only on computing these sets but getting an early glimpse as to what's <em>universally true</em> about them.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given two finite sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span>, write out their Cartesian product <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> in roster notation.</li>
<li>Given a finite set <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, write out its power set <span class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> in roster notation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Given three or more finite sets, write out their Cartesian product <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> in roster notation.</li>
<li>Determine whether an object is or is not an element of the power set of a set.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>, read Section 1.3. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/HqZZwoTYElo">Cartesian Products Made Easy</a> (5:00) This has a nice alternative description of forming the Cartesian product using a table.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEcRlxRCfco">Proof and Problem Solving -- More Sets</a> The video is 5:09 long, but you can stop watching after 3:08 because the presenter goes into some advanced counting concepts we will take up later. Note also the presenter uses the notation <span class="math">\(\{ \}\)</span> for the empty set instead of <span class="math">\(\emptyset\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let <span class="math">\(A = \{10, 20, 30\}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B = \{x,y,z\}\)</span>. Write out the Cartesian product <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> in roster notation. Note that there will be nine elements.</li>
<li>Using the sets <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> from question 1, is <span class="math">\(A \times B\)</span> the same thing as <span class="math">\(B \times A\)</span>? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Using the set <span class="math">\(B\)</span> from question 1, write out the power set <span class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(B)\)</span> in roster notation.</li>
<li>Let <span class="math">\(T\)</span> be the set of all user accounts on Twitter (like <span class="citation">@GVSUmath</span>, <span class="citation">@RobertTalbert</span>, <span class="citation">@realDonaldTrump</span>, etc.). What does the set <span class="math">\(T \times T\)</span> look like, and why might this set be useful for the people who use or manage Twitter?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>There is a final item at the response form that solicits any specific mathematical questions or comments you may have about the material in the reading or viewing. If you have any specific mathematical questions, leave them in the blank. Frequently occurring questions will be addressed during the discussion time in class. Other questions (good but not frequently occurring) will be replied to in person on through email. If you have no questions, just leave that item blank.</p>
