<h1 id="mth-325-guided-practice-9.3-connectivity">MTH 325 Guided Practice 9.3: Connectivity</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section we take up what at first appears to be a pair of almost trivial questions: (1) Given two vertices in a graph, is there a path between them?, and (2) if so, what is that path? The idea of having paths between distinct vertices is at the heart of the issue of <em>connectivity</em>. You’ll be learning what it means for a graph to be <em>connected</em> (and in the case of a directed graph, <em>strongly connected</em>), and we’ll examine three algorithms for determining whether two vertices are connected by a path. One of those algorithms involves the <em>transitive closure</em> and therefore powers of the graph’s adjacency matrix. The other two introduce two very important search algorithms, the Breadth-First Search (BFS) and the Depth-First Seach (DFS).</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). Note that important new terminology is given in italics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Give examples of connected graphs and non-connected graphs, and determine visually whether a graph is connected or not.</li>
<li>State Theorem 9.3.1 and explain what it says.</li>
<li>Determine whether two vertices in a graph are connected by a path by examining the adjacency matrix for the graph's transitive closure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a path between two vertices in a graph using a breadth-first search.</li>
<li>Find a path between two vertices in a graph using a depth-first search.</li>
<li>Use Sage to do the following: find a shortest path between two vertices in a graph; perform a breadth-first search starting at a vertex; perform a depth-first search starting at a vertex.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>ADS</em>, read Section 9.3 -- but skip the entire part that begins with &quot;Method 2: Broadcasting&quot; up to Example 9.3.2; then use Example 9.3.2 to practice breadth-first search; then skip the &quot;Mathematica note&quot;, and end by working with the &quot;Sage Note&quot; (again, have Sage up in front of you so you can practice the coding). The Sage Note shows you how to use Sage's built-ins for doing breadth- and depth-first searches and for finding the shortest path between vertices in a graph.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>Consider the following adjacency matrix for a graph on 8 vertices: <span class="math display">\[\left(\begin{array}{rrrrrrrr}

<li>Suppose there is a path from one vertex to another in this graph. What does Theorem 9.3.1 say about the length of such a path?</li>

<p>According to &quot;Method 1&quot; in your textbook, is the original graph connected? Explain how you know.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Assume that the vertices in this graph are <span class="math inline">\(0, 1, 2, \dots, 7\)</span>. In this graph, which vertices are connected to each other? For example we can tell from the original adjacency matrix that 0 is connected to 3 by a direct edge (that is, a path of length 1).</li>
