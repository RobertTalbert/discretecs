# MTH 225 Guided Practice 3.2: Truth Tables and Propositions Generated by a Set 

## Overview

In the previous lesson, we learned about _propositions_ and basic ways of combining them using logical operators. The idea of a _truth table_ was important for us in encoding when a combination of propositions is true or false. In this lesson we take this idea a step further to look at more complex propositions that involve several smaller ones, joined by logical operators. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

+ Construct a truth table for a proposition that involves two "basic" propositions and 2--4 logical operators. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Construct a truth table for a proposition that involves two "basic" propositions and 4 or more logical operators. 
+ Construct a truth table for a proposition that involves three or more "basic" propositions and 2--4 logical operators. 

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _ADS_, read Section 3.2. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos from the MTH 210 YouTube playlist:

+ [Truth tables part 1](https://youtu.be/d2yksDk4h6s) (6:06)
+ [Truth tables part 2](https://youtu.be/GKRryCRG4Tk) (5:50) 
+ [Truth tables part 3](https://youtu.be/0j0DsAWbP7E) (6:16)
+ [Truth tables part 4](https://youtu.be/_GD25pbPTFs) (7:03) 

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

1. Consider the proposition $p \wedge \neg p$. Here is a setup for the truth table for this proposition, including the intermediate column (in the middle) needed to build up to the main proposition:

<!-- | $p$ | $\neg p$ | $p \wedge \neg p$ |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ | 
| 1 | 0 |  | 
| 0 | 1 |  | 
 -->
At the submission form, indicate what truth values should go in each missing row. (There are two separate multiple choice items for this.) 

2. Explain why the result of the truth table in the first exercise makes sense from a common-sense standpoint. 
3. Consider the proposition $\neg p \vee \neg q$. Here is a partially-filled in truth table for this proposition:

<!-- | $p$ | $q$ | $\neg p$ | $\neg q$ | $\neg p \vee \neg q$ 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

| 0 | 1 |   |   |   | 
| 0 | 0 |   |   |   |  -->

At the submission form, indicate what truth values should go in each missing row. (There are three separate multiple choice items for this.)
