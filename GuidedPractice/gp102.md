# MTH 325 Guided Practice 10.2: Spanning trees

## Overview

Now that we have some basic notions of trees under our belts, we will look at the problem of finding a __spanning tree__ for a graph -- that's a tree that contains all of the vertices of a graph but not all of the edges. Spanning trees provide a sort of "skeleton" structure for a complex graph and have appliations in search algorithms, network design, and other areas in CS. We'll look at _Prim's Algorithm_ for finding a __minimum spanning tree__ for a weighted graph -- that is, a spanning tree inside a weighted graph that has the lowest total cost. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). Note that important new terminology is given in italics. 

+ Given a graph and one of its subgraphs, determine whether that subgraph is a spanning tree. 
+ Identify the bridge edges in a graph. 
+ Give a comprehensive outline of how Prim's Algorithm works. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Use Prim's Algorithm to find a minimal spanning tree in a graph.  

## Learning resources 

__Reading:__ Read Section 10.2 of your textbook except for the part at the end on the "Minimum Diameter Spanning Tree Problem". You can read that if you want to, but it's optional.

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

The exercises below refer to this weighted graph. The weights are superimposed on the edges:

In case you can't see the edge weights, the complete weighted edge list is: [(0, 1, 7), (0, 4, 6), (0, 5, 9), (0, 6, 10), (1, 2, 8), (1, 3, 5), (1, 4, 8), (2, 3, 5), (2, 6, 6), (3, 6, 9), (4, 5, 9), (5, 6, 6)]. 

1. Identify one spanning tree for this graph. You do not need to consider the weights; just find a spanning tree. Give your finding in the form of an edge list (without the weights). 
2. The definition of a _bridge_ refers to a "partition" of the set $V$ of vertices in the graph. A partition is a pair of sets that are disjoint (no intersection) and whose union is all of $V$. For example above, one partition would be $L = \{ 0, 4, 5 \}$ and $R = \{1, 2, 3, 6\}$. Given this partition, identify all the bridges between $L$ and $R$ and then identify a bridge of lowest weight.  
3. Let $v_0 = 0$ in the graph above. Starting with $v_0$ as the initial vertex in Prim's Algorithm, run through Prim's Algorithm with this graph to find a minimal spanning tree for the graph. Give your result as an edge list (including the weights) and then state the total weight of the tree.
