<h1 id="mth-225-guided-practice-probability-1">MTH 225 Guided Practice Probability 1:</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>If you're playing poker with friends, trying to analyze the running time of an algorithm where the input is more or less random, or thinking about what the weather might look like today, you're interested in <em>quantifying events that are uncertain</em>. You don't <em>know</em> what hand you'll be dealt, or what input set will come in from a user of your software, or whether it will actually rain today. However, we can still quantify these events by thinking about the big picture: some card hands are more common than others, for example, and so we can discuss <em>how likely</em> you are to be dealt a certain hand.</p>
<p>Quantifying the uncertain is the essence of <em>probability</em> and this is our last unit of the course. This unit builds upon what we've learned about sets and (especially) about counting, to provide you with important tools for measuring uncertainty and making smart decisions in the face of uncertainty.</p>
<p>The first lesson in this unit will lay out the basics of a mathematical study of probability: the concept of a <em>sample space</em> and using counting techniques to define the <em>probability</em> of an event occurring in a sample space, and some simple rules for determining the probability of an event based on the probabilities of related events.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the probability of a simple event in a sample space.</li>
<li>Determine the probability of the complement of an event.</li>
<li>Determine the probability of the union of two events.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Solve applied probability questions arising from randomized algorithms and games of chance by applying the basic rules of probability.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>Note: For this and all other lessons in the probability unit, we will be using Chapter 6 from <em>Discrete Mathematics and its Applications</em>, sixth edition by Kenneth Rosen. A PDF of this chapter is available at the Blackboard site in the <strong>Textbook and software</strong> section. However, for your reading, I am using your class to beta-test a new software service called <strong>Perusall</strong> that will allow you to access the chapters of the book and engage in a threaded discussion about its contents. You can access the materials at Perusall by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://app.perusall.com" class="uri">http://app.perusall.com</a> and create a free account.</li>
<li>Then enter in the access code <code>TALBERT-9528</code> to enroll in the MTH 225 course that has been set up.</li>
<li>Look for the <strong>Discrete probability 6.1</strong> document that has been set up for you, and open it up.</li>
<li>As you read through the text, you can add annotations to the text and ask questions, and all other students in the course (including the other MTH 225 section) can read your questions and comment and provide their thoughts.</li>
<li>Perusall uses machine learning to score your questions and comments and provide me with a synopsis of the discussion and a provisional grade for your work. <strong>I will be monitoring these grades and the results may be used to provide students with additional Learning Community credits.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Please look for a brief video introduction to Perusall and more information coming your way soon. Also realize that <strong>the use of Perusall is optional, and if it gives you trouble, then just use the PDF at the Blackboard site</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<p><img src="12sided.jpg"></p>
<p>Suppose you are playing a fantasy role-playing game that involves rolling dice of various numbers of faces. You have 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-sided dice at your disposal. At one point in the game you are asked to roll the 12-sided die (with faces labeled 1, 2, ..., 12 as shown in the picture) to determine the outcome of an encounter with a monster.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>What is the probability that you will roll a 4 or lower?</li>
<li>What is the probability that you will roll an even number?</li>
<li>What is the probability that you will roll either an even number or a 4 or lower?</li>
<li>Actually it turns out that the 12-sided die is rigged, so that the probability of rolling a 5 or lower is 0.71. What is the probability of rolling a 6 or higher on this die?</li>
<li>Your dungeon master (the person who runs the game and makes sure the rules are being followed, and also provides the Cheetos and Mountain Dew) knows that, in this encounter with the monster, the probability of your being seriously wounded is 0.6, and the probability of being captured is 0.5. Therefore he calculates that the probability of being either seriously wounded or captured is 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.1. Is this right? If not, what's wrong about it and how would you fix it?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h2>
<p>Submit your responses using the form at this link: <a href="http://bit.ly/1SD9qvt" class="uri">http://bit.ly/1SD9qvt</a></p>
<p>Note that although you can provide specific mathematical questions as always on this form, you're encouraged to use Perusall to ask questions because you might get more immediate help from classmates this way.</p>
