    "## Part 4: Indirect Proof \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "We continue our look at proof techniques by looking at another way of proving a conditional statement. In the last lesson we looked at _proof by contraposition_, which goes as follows: Given the statement $p \\rightarrow q$, we assume $\\neg q$ and prove $\\neg p$. Since the contrapositive $\\neg q \\rightarrow \\neg p$ is logically equivalent to the original $p \\rightarrow q$, proving one is the same as proving the other. Contraposition is handy when your original conditional statement has a lot of \"nots\" in it, since the negations turn the negative statements into positive ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "This time (also in the next lesson) we're going to look at a variation on this theme known as _indirect proof_ or _proof by contradiction_. In an indirect proof, we use the __Indirect Reasoning__ law from the Laws of Logic, which states that \n",
    "$$(p \\rightarrow q) \\wedge \\neg q \\Rightarrow \\neg p$$\n",
    "So if we want to prove the statement $p \\rightarrow q$, we first assume that $p$ is true _and_ $\\neg q$ is true -- then using those assumptions, follow the logic until it leads us into a contradiction. We then conclude that the assumption $\\neg q$ must have been incorrect, so therefore $q$ is true. Mysterious, but powerful method of argumentation. \n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following courtroom drama:\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice is being accused of murdering Bob on September 1 between the hours of 7pm and 8pm. She was found wandering the streets with a bloody knife in the vicinity of the crime around 8:30pm, so she looks like a prime suspect. However, her lawyer has a bombshell piece of evidence to give. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"Your honor,\" says her lawyer, \"My client is innocent. I will prove this to you now. Let's suppose she really did commit the crime.\" Gasps come from the courtroom and the jury. How could the lawyer _assume_ that his client is guilty when he is supposed to be proving she is innocent? \n",
    "\n",
    "He continues: \"If she committed the crime, then she must have been at the scene of the crime during 7pm and 8pm. Let's suppose she was. But, I have evidence here from her employer...\" Here he hands over a piece of paper to the judge. \"And this evidence shows that she was at her place of employment, which is a butcher shop, until she got off work at 8:10pm. That explains the knife. But the evidence contradicts the fact that the crime took place between 7pm and 8pm. Therefore she cannot have committed the crime because she cannot be in two places at once!\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The courtroom erupts. \"Order! Order!\" cries the judge as she bangs the gavel on the podium. But the lawyer slips into his seat smiling, knowing that his logic is impeccable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Was the lawyer's logic convincing to you? Here is the outline of his argument: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume that Alice is not innocent. That is -- assume the exact opposite of what you want to prove. \n",
    "2. Under this assumption, she committed the murder and that means she had to be at the scene of the crime between 7pm and 8pm.\n",
    "3. However, this is a contradiction, because we have incontrovertible proof that she was at work between 7pm and 8pm. \n",
    "4. Therefore the assumption that Alice is not innocent, is false. Which means that Alice _is_ innocent. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method of reasoning is called _indirect_ reasoning, or _proof by contradiction_, and it's a third way to think about the proof of a conditional statement. It's a powerful way to argue any point, and it has particular power in mathematics and CS. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect proofs (a.k.a. proofs by contradiction) have the following structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assume the _negation_ of the statement you are trying to prove. For conditional statements $p \\rightarrow q$, that negation is $p \\wedge \\neg q$ -- that is, assume the usual hypothesis _and_ the _negation_ of the conclusion. \n",
    "2. Using logic, previously proven results, known facts, etc. use the assumptions against each other to arrive at a contradiction -- something that cannot possibly be true. \n",
    "3. Because we arrived at a contradiction, the assumption that the _negation_ of our statement is true, is false. Therefore the negation of the statement is false; hence the statement itself is true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of it being used in a mathematical proof, on a proposition that we've seen in a previous class: \n",
    "\n",
    "__Proposition:__ For all real numbers $x,y$, if $x \\neq y$, $x > 0$, and $y > 0$, then $x/y + y/x > 2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Proof:__ (By contradiction.) Assume the opposite of what we are trying to prove, namely that we have two real numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x \\neq y$, $x > 0$, and $y > 0$ _and also_ that $x/y + y/x \\leq 2$. (Note the change in the inequality.) Since $x, y > 0$ we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $x$ and by $y$ without changing the direction of the inequality: \n",
    "$$(xy)(x/y) + (xy)(y/x) \\leq 2xy$$\n",
    "And multiplying out the left side gives \n",
    "$$x^2 + y^2 \\leq 2xy$$\n",
    "Now subtract over the $2xy$ to get $x^2 - 2xy + y^2 \\leq 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "(_Heads up: Here comes a contradiction._) However: We can factor the left side to get \n",
    "$$(x - y)^2 \\leq 0$$\n",
    "Since we are _squaring_ the left side, the result cannot be negative. So the only way for this inequality to be true is if $x-y = 0$. But that would mean $x=y$, which contradicts the assumption that $x \\neq y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we have arrived at a contradiction, so the assumption that the original proposition is false, must itself be false -- that is, the original proposition must be true. That is, it must be the case that $x/y + y/x > 2$. $\\square$\n",
    "\n",
    "What a trip! \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in this proof how we used a result that we had previously proven, namely that if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even. We proved that using contraposition. Just as how, in a well-written computer program, we develop code in a modular way and farm out helping tasks to subroutines in order to keep the main program simple, in mathematics we prove simple results off to the side and \"import\" them as necessary in bigger proofs whenever we need them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indirect proof is especially helpful in situations similar to proof by contraposition where there are a lot of \"negative\" statements being made. One very common class of statements has to do with _irrational_ versus _rational_ numbers. Here is a definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition:__ A number $x$ is said to be _rational_ if there exist integers $p$ and $q$ with $q \\neq 0$ and $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$ such that $x = p/q$. The number $x$ is _irrational_ if it is not rational, i.e. there are no such integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Examples:__ Any valid fraction of integers is a rational number, such as $3/5$ or $-199/2$. Any finite decimal is rational because you can make it into a fraction with a power of 10 in the denominator, for example $3.14159 = 314159/100000$. Any integer is a rational number because you can write it as a fraction with $1$ on the bottom, e.g. $5 = 5/1$. However lots of numbers are irrational, some of the more famous ones being $\\pi$ and $\\sqrt{2}$. These cannot be represented exactly using a finite decimal or fraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the word \"rational\" because it has the word \"ratio\" in it, which is the idea we are trying to express. The $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$ condition is there to ensure that the fraction we form is in lowest form (e.g. $2/5$ as opposed to $4/10$). Pay attention to that gcd condition, because it comes up big in a minute. \n",
    "\n",
    "We said that $\\pi$ and $\\sqrt{2}$ are irrational, but how do we really know this is the case? We would need to prove that _there exists no fraction of integers to which those numbers are equal_. But that's proving that something _doesn't exist_! How do you prove something doesn't exist? \n",
    "\n",
    "One answer to that question is to use contradiction. Here is a famous proof that you should study and get familiar with: \n",
    "\n",
    "__Proposition:__ The number $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Proof:__ (By contradiction.) Assume the negation of the proposition, namely that $\\sqrt{2}$ is a rational number. This means that there exist integers $p,q$ with $q \\neq 0$ and $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$ such that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{p}{q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Squaring both sides gives: \n",
    "$$2 = \\frac{p^2}{q^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying both sides by $q^2$ gives us $2q^2 = p^2$. This means that $p^2$ is even, since it is an integer ($q^2$) multiple of 2. Since $p^2$ is even, it follows from previous proofs that $p$ itself is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since $p$ is even, there exists an integer $k$ such that $p = 2k$. Therefore $p^2 = 4k^2$. Substituting this into $2q^2 = p^2$ gives \n",
    "$$2q^2 = 4k^2$$\n",
    "Therefore $q^2 = 2k^2$, which implies that $q^2$ is even. Since $q^2$ is even, $q$ itself is even. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have shown at this point that both $p$ and $q$ are even. __But this is a contradiction to the assumption that $\\gcd(p,q)=1$__, since the GCD of two even integers must be at least 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore we have arrived at a contradiction, so our supposition that $\\sqrt{2}$ is rational must be false; therefore $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. $\\square$\n",
    "\n",
    "Mind. Blown. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice a lot of similarities between proof by contradiction and proof by contraposition. In both methods of proof, if we are trying to prove $p \\rightarrow q$ then we begin by assuming $\\neg q$. And sometimes contraposition is more straightforward and easier to understand. However contradiction has two facets that sometimes make it preferable to contraposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Generally speaking, the more assumptions you get to make in a proof, the better -- and in a contradiction proof you get to assume not only $\\neg q$ but also $p$. Two assumptions instead of one. \n",
    "+ One thing that the $\\sqrt{2}$ proof shows you is that _indirect proof also works on statements that are not conditional statements_. The proposition we proved was not conditional; it just states that $\\sqrt{2}$ is irrational. You can't really use contraposition unless you have an if-then statement. So indirect proof is usable on a larger set of propositions than contraposition. \n",
