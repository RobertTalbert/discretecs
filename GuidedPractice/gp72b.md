# MTH 325 Guided Practice 7.2b: Bijective functions and the Pigeonhole Principle    

## Overview

We've just learned about _injective functions_ (functions with "no collisions") and _surjective functions_ (functions that "cover everything"). In this lesson we put these ideas together to examine _bijective_ functions -- functions that are both injective and surjective -- and their uses. In particular we look at two applications of bijective functions: finding the cardinality of an infinite set, and the _Pigeonhole Principle_. 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

+ Determine whether a function is bijective. 
+ State the Pigeonhole Principle. 

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Determine whether a set is countable. 
+ Use the Piegonhole Principle to solve counting and enumeration problems. 

## Learning resources 

For this section, don't do any reading or video watching because it spoils the surprise. The only thing you need to do is Google the following terms: 

+ The definition of a _bijective function_, 
+ The definition of the _cardinality_ of a set, and 
+ A statement of the _Pigeonhole Principle_. 

## Exercises

Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

1. How many people do you need to gather in a room before you can be certain that at least two people in the room were born on the same day of the week (Sunday, etc.)? State your answer and explain your reasoning. 
2. Suppose you were given a function from the set $\{1,2,3,4\}$ to the set $\{a,b,c\}$. Can this function possibly be injective? Why or why not? (Hint: There is a connection between this question and the first one.)
3. Consider the sets $\mathbb{Z}$ (the set of all integers) and the set $\{0, \pm 3, \pm 6, \pm 9, \dots\}$ (the set of all integer multiples of 3). Notice that the second set is a subset of the first one. Is it possible to have a bijection between these two sets? Explain why or why not.
