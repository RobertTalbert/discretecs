# MTH 225 Guided Practice 3.3: Equivalence and Implication

## Overview

We've now learned about propositions and how to use a truth table to determine the conditions under which a proposition is true or false. In this lesson we want to consider the question: _What does it mean when two different-looking propositions end up having the same truth tables?_ Such propositions would be _logically_ the same although they are _superficially_ different. We will call those kinds of propositions __equivalent__. Also in this lesson we take up again the idea of the conditional statement and 

## Learning objectives

__Basic objectives__: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks _prior_ to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below). 

+ Explain what it means to say that two propositions are _logically equivalent_.
+ Use truth tables to determine whether two propositions generated by 2--3 basic propositions are logically equivalent.
+ Use truth tables to determine whether a proposition generated by 2--3 basic propositions a tautology or a contradiction or neither.

__Advanced objectives__: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student _during_ and _following_ class discussions. 

+ Use truth tables to determine whether two propositions generated by 4 or more basic propositions are logically equivalent.
+ Use truth tables to determine whether a proposition generated by 4 or more basic propositions a tautology or a contradiction or neither

## Learning resources 

To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following. 

__Textbook__: In _Applied Discrete Structures_, read Section 3.3. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go. 

__Video__: Watch the following videos at the MTH 210 YouTube playlist (http://bit.ly/GVSUCalculus). 

+ [Tautologies and contradictions, part 1](https://youtu.be/w6_Yldevy5s) (6:43)
+ [Tautologies and contradictions, part 2](https://youtu.be/8nB1e64CzJM) (4:16)
+ [Logical equivalence](https://youtu.be/oY8Xt5GvZ1g) (8:02) -- Note that for logical equivalence your book uses the notation $\Leftrightarrow$ instead of $\equiv$. We will use the left/right arrow notation as well. 

__Comic__: Enjoy the following xkcd comic.

## Exercises

The following exercises are to be done _during_ and _following_ your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of __Pass__ if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline. 

1. Here are four propositions. Determine which ones are logically equivalent. 

$$p \rightarrow q \qquad  \neg p \leftrightarrow q \qquad \neg q \rightarrow \neg p \qquad p \leftrightarrow \neg q$$

2. Consider the proposition $(p \vee \neg p)$. Use a truth table to determine whether this proposition is a tautology, a contradiction, or neither. Then explain why your answer makes sense from a common-sense perspective without any reference to a truth table. 
3. Consider the proposition: $(p \rightarrow q) \wedge (p \wedge \neg q)$. Use a truth table to determine whether this proposition is a tautology, a contradiction, or neither. Then explain why your answer makes sense from a common-sense perspective without any reference to a truth table.
