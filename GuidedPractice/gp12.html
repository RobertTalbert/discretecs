<h1 id="mth-225-guided-practice-1.2-basic-set-operations">MTH 225 Guided Practice 1.2: Basic Set Operations</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In the last section, we learned the basics of <em>sets</em> as very simple &quot;data structures&quot; and how to represent those structures. In mathematics when we create a new structure, we often want to talk about what we can <em>do</em> with those structures, and that's the gist of our next class. In this lesson, you'll learn about some basic <strong>operations</strong> that you can perform on sets, namely <em>intersection</em>, <em>union</em>, <em>complement</em>, and <em>symmetric difference</em>. We'll also get a glimpse of some of the <em>properties</em> of these set operations and the rules they obey.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given two sets (in either roster or set-builder notation), find their intersection, union, complement, and symmetric difference.</li>
<li>Determine whether two sets are disjoint.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Represent set operations using a Venn diagram.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>To gain proficiency in the learning objectives, use the following resources. You may include other resources if you wish, in addition to or in replacement of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Textbook</strong>: In <em>Applied Discrete Structures</em>, read Section 1.2. Make sure to read actively, working through examples and activities as you go.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong>: Watch the following videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/En8fI2ixepo">Sets: Union and Intersection</a> (5:39) -- note the notational error at 4:10, though, which he corrects with a pop-up note.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/xJheQ_sZhMU">The Universal Set and Set Complements</a> (3:57)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading and viewing of the resources. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Let <span class="math">\(A = \{a,b,c,d,e\}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(B = \{a,b,1,2\}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> the set of all vowels in the English language (do not include ``y''). Let <span class="math">\(U\)</span> be the universal set <span class="math">\(\{a,b,c,d,e,1,2,3\}\)</span>. Find each of the following and write the result using roster notation. If the set is empty, write &quot;empty&quot;.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><span class="math">\(A \cup B\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap B\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(A \cap C\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math">\(B \cap C\)</span></li>

<li><span class="math">\(B \oplus C\)</span></li>

<li>The following website allows you to enter in sets given as lists, and then it will draw a Venn diagram for those sets: <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.lu/venn.php">http://www.bioinformatics.lu/venn.php</a> <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/RFIQCvm2">Here is a screenshot</a> showing how to enter in the information (put the name of the set in the top blanks, then enter the elements of the sets in the larger box one row at a time). In each of the following, make up examples of the kinds of sets being described and play with them using the website and the Venn diagrams that are generated, and then give an educated guess and explanation for each question.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Suppose you have two sets that each have five elements in them, and no elements in common. (That is, the sets are &quot;disjoint&quot;.) What is the cardinality of their union? Their intersection? Their symmetric difference? Give a brief explanation.</li>
<li>Suppose you have two sets that each have five elements in them, and one of those elements are in common. What is the cardinality of their union? Their intersection? Their symmetric difference? Give a brief explanation.</li>
<li>Suppose you have two sets that each have five elements in them, and four of those elements are in common. What is the cardinality of their union? Their intersection? Their symmetric difference? Give a brief explanation.</li>
<li>What patterns do you notice from the previous questions pertaining to the cardinality of the <em>union</em> and <em>symmetric difference</em> of two finite setes? (That is, can you see a common thread in how these quantities are computed in each of the examples? Express that common thread as best you can, because eventually we can turn this into an algorithm.)</li>
</ol></li>

<p>There is a final item at the response form that solicits any specific mathematical questions or comments you may have about the material in the reading or viewing. If you have any specific mathematical questions, leave them in the blank. Frequently occurring questions will be addressed during the discussion time in class. Other questions (good but not frequently occurring) will be replied to in person on through email. If you have no questions, just leave that item blank.</p>
