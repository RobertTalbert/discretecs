    "+ _If an integer is divisible by 10, then it is divisible by 5._ This is a true statement, but its converse says: _If an integer is divisible by 5, then it is divisible by 10_ which is false because the number 25 would be a counterexample. (It's divisible by 5 but not by 10.) \n",
    "+ _If the temperature outside is 20 degrees, then water outside will freeze._ This is true, but its converse says: _If the water outside freezes, the temperature outside is 20 degrees._ That's not true necessarily because water can freeze at other temperatures besides 20 degrees. "
