<h1 id="mth-225-guided-practice-2.2-permutations">MTH 225 Guided Practice 2.2: Permutations</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In our previous lesson, we learned to use the Rule of Products to count arrangements that are made by a sequence of independent choices. But not all arrangements are made this way, meaning that we need more tools to solve problems where the Rule of Products doesn't apply. One such problem has to do with <em>permutations</em> or &quot;shufflings&quot; of a group of items. For example, if you have five people who want to go on a road trip, and there are five seats in the car, how many ways are there to arrange people in the car? What if there were six seats and one of the seats could stay open? It gets complicated, so we need the math of permutations to help us think.</p>
<p>Also in this section, an important mathematical calculation: The <em>factorial</em> of an integer.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate the factorial of an integer.</li>
<li>Calculate the total number of permuations of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> elements taken from a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> elements.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the concept of permutations to solve counting problems.</li>
<li>Apply the concept of permutations together with the Rule of Products to solve counting problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>This is another section where you'll learn more if you <em>don't</em> read or view videos prior to class but rather just play with the exercises below. However you do need to search up the definition of the <em>factorial</em>. This is in the book or you can Google it. Also learn how to calculate factorials on your calculator or computer software.</p>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How many three-digit numbers can you make using only the digits 3, 5, and 7 -- assuming repetitions of the digits is OK? For example: 335 and 735 are OK. State your answer and list all the possible arrangements.</li>
<li>How many three-digit numbers can you make using only the digits 3, 5, and 7 -- assuming repetitions of the digits is <em>not</em> OK? For example: 735 is still OK, but 335 is not. State your answer and list all the possible arrangements.</li>
<li>How many five-digit numbers can you make using only the digits 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 and assuming that repetitions are not allowed? State your answer but <em>do not list all of these</em>, rather explain why your answer is right. How would your answer change if repetition were allowed?</li>
<li>How many <em>three</em>-digit numbers can you make, using the <em>five</em> digits 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 without repeating any of the digits? State your answer and explain your reasoning.</li>
<li>Basic practice: Compute the numbers 5! and 3! (&quot;five factorial&quot; and &quot;three factorial&quot;). What role did these numbers play in the first four questions?</li>
