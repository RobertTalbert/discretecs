<h1 id="mth-225-guided-practice-probability-4-bayes-theorem-and-expected-value">MTH 225 Guided Practice Probability 4: Bayes' Theorem and Expected Value</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Our final lesson in probability will consider two separate topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bayes' Theorem</em> is a powerful result on conditional probability that allows us to predict with greater certainty the outcome of a random event, given information about prior events. It is used for example to predict the outcomes of medical clinical trials and is used in the construction of effective spam filters on email clients.</li>
<li>The concept of expected value uses probability to determine the expected outcome of a random event. This is different than the <em>probability</em> of the event. For example, if you buy 100 tickets to a raffle in which the top three prizes are $100, $50, and $10, what is the expected amount you will win?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning objectives</h2>
<p><strong>Basic objectives</strong>: Each student is responsible for gaining proficiency with each of these tasks <em>prior</em> to engaging in class discussions, through the use of the learning resources (below) and through the working of exercises (also below).</p>
<ul>
<li>Given two events <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> and the following probabilities: <span class="math inline">\(p(E)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p(F)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p(E | F)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p(E | \bar{F})\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p(\bar{F})\)</span> -- use Bayes' Theorem to compute <span class="math inline">\(P(F | E)\)</span> and explain the meaning of the result.</li>
<li>Calculate the expected value of a random variable, such as the expectation of rolling a die or flipping a coin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Advanced objectives</strong>: The following objectives are the subject of class discussion and further work; they should be mastered by each student <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> class discussions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply Bayes' Theorem to find conditional probabilities arising from real-world applications such as probabilities involved in clinical trials.</li>
<li>Use Theorem 2 (page 428) to find the expected value of a Bernoulli trial.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="learning-resources">Learning resources</h2>
<p>Your reading this time will come from two different parts of the Rosen text:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Read in Section 6.3 from page 417 through 420, stopping at &quot;Generalized Bayes' Theorem&quot;. Pay particular attention to Example 2, which is an important application. Then, skip over to page 421 and read the application on Bayesian Spam Filters (which continues through the end of the section).</li>
<li>Read in Section 6.4 from page 426 through page 429, stopping at &quot;Linearity of Expectations&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are again encouraged to use <a href="http://app.perusall.com">Perusall</a> to do your reading, since you can leave comments and questions in the text and help others out as well. Please see previous Guided Practice assignments and Blackboard announcements for instructions.</p>
<p>Here are some video resources to help:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z497JBKJDt0">Example of Bayes' Theorem involving cookies</a> (the baked kind, not the website kind)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XR1zovKxilw&amp;list=PL80617F2D676B2863">Here is an entire YouTube playlist on Bayes' Theorem</a> in case you are interested that takes a less technical approach.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAjVAEDil_Q">Expected value</a> (7:57)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>
<p>The following exercises are to be done <em>during</em> and <em>following</em> your reading. Work these out on paper and then enter the responses into the appropriate submission form (see Submission Instructions) by the deadline. You will receive a mark of <strong>Pass</strong> if each item response shows a good-faith effort to be right and is submitted prior to the deadline.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> are events in a sample space such that <span class="math inline">\(p(E) = 1/3\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p(F) = 1/2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(p(E | F) = 2/5\)</span>. Find <span class="math inline">\(p(F | E)\)</span>.</li>
<li>What is the expected number of heads that come up when a fair coin is flipped five times?</li>
<li>Suppose the final exam in a discrete math course consists of 50 true/false questions, each worth 2 points. Also suppose that if you were to guess randomly on each question, you have a probability of 0.8 of getting the right answer. If you guessed randomly on the entire exam, what is your expected score?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h2>
<p>Submit your responses using the form at this link: <a href="http://bit.ly/1M8YJON" class="uri">http://bit.ly/1M8YJON</a></p>
<p>Note that although you can provide specific mathematical questions as always on this form, you're encouraged to use Perusall to ask questions because you might get more immediate help from classmates this way.</p>
