<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Many of the graphs we've seen have lots of edges, and when this happens the edges tend to cross over each other. But is it possible to draw such a graph in a different way so that the edges <em>don't</em> cross each other? For some graphs, it's obvious (example: <span class="math"><em>W</em><sub>5</sub></span>) but for others, it's not clear whether this can be done or not (example: <span class="math"><em>K</em><sub>5</sub></span>). In this section we formalize this property of graphs through the idea of <em>planarity</em>. We first visit a classical result from geometry called <em>Euler's Formula</em> that connects the 2D regions created by a planar graph with its number of edges and nodes. That result yields two important by-product theorems that can help us determine easily whether a graph can be drawn without edge crossings in the plane or not.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.25: State the definitions of the following terms: Planar graph.</li>
<li>CC.26: State Euler's formula and use it to determine information about regions, nodes, or edges in a connected planar simple graph.</li>
<li>M.23 (CORE): Use the Corollaries to Euler's Formula to determine information about the planarity of a graph or about nodes or edges in a planar graph.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for learning</h2>
<p>Read through Section 9.7 in your textbook as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <strong>Introduction</strong> up to the section <strong>Euler's Formula</strong> carefully and for comprehension, especially making sure to understand Examples 1--3.</li>
<li>Read through the section <strong>Euler's Formula</strong>, paying special attention to the terminology (especially the definition of &quot;regions&quot;), the statement of Euler's Formula, the statements of the two Corollaries to Euler's formula, and Examples 4, 5, and 6. For now, read the proofs of the mathematical results only if you are curious. We will discuss the proofs in class.</li>
<li>You can stop at <strong>Kuratowski's Theorem</strong>. That part of the section is optional and involves some new terminology for which you are not going to be held responsible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>These activities involve playing the game <strong>Planarity</strong>. You can find this on the web at <a href="http://planarity.net/">http://planarity.net/</a>. There are also iOS and Android apps available that allow you to play on your phone or tablet. In each round of Planarity, you are given a graph where the edges are crossing. Your job is to drag the nodes of the graph to rearrange things so that the edges don't cross. Yes: It is possible to do so for every graph you see in the game. But it gets quite difficult pretty quickly.</p>
<p>For your activity this time, you are to <strong>play -- and win! -- at least three rounds of Planarity</strong>. On the response form, each time you win a round, enter in: the degree sequence for the graph (given as a list of integers, like [2,2,4,6]), the number <span class="math"><em>v</em></span> of nodes, the number <span class="math"><em>e</em></span> of edges, the number <span class="math"><em>r</em></span> of 2D regions created by the graph (remember to include the infinite region on the &quot;outside&quot; of the graph), and your calculation of <span class="math"><em>r</em> − <em>e</em> + <em>v</em></span>. Also, write down your graph's information on paper and bring it with you to class, because we'll use the data as part of the class discussion.</p>
<p>For example, here is a finished game from Level 2:</p>
<p><a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/talbertr/folders/MTH%20325%20Images/media/ff5cfa06-4c09-435f-8cd9-a99a68ec2940/2015-02-26_15-34-19.png"><img class="embeddedObject" src="http://content.screencast.com/users/talbertr/folders/MTH%20325%20Images/media/ff5cfa06-4c09-435f-8cd9-a99a68ec2940/2015-02-26_15-34-19.png" width="400" height="400" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>In this picture, the degree sequence is [2,3,4,4,3,4,2,3,3,2]. The number of nodes is <span class="math"><em>v</em> = 10</span>; the number of edges is <span class="math"><em>e</em> = 15</span>; and the number of regions is <span class="math"><em>r</em> = 7</span>.</p>
<p>For more information about what a &quot;Region&quot; is for a graph, re-read the text paragraph just underneath the section heading for <strong>Euler's Formula</strong> and study Figure 8 in the book, and/or use Google.</p>
