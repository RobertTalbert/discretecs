<h1 id="guided-practice-for-mth-325-section-9.6">Guided Practice for MTH 325: Section 9.6</h1>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this section we introduce two very important and interrelated concepts. First we define the <em>weighted graph</em>, which is a graph in which the edges have different &quot;costs&quot; associated with them. For example, we can model a highway system by connecting cities with edges whose weights are the distances between the cities; so the edges carry information relevant to the graph. With the notion of weighted graphs comes the question: Given two nodes that are connected by a path, which of those paths has the least total weight? To answer this &quot;<em>shortest path</em>&quot; problem we will introduce <em>Dijkstra's Algorithm</em> which solves this problem in a clever and efficient way.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.24: Find the length (total weight) of a path in a weighted graph.</li>
<li>M.22: Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources-for-learning">Resources for learning</h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The idea of a weighted graph is fairly basic, but Dijkstra's Algorithm takes repeated effort before you finally &quot;get it&quot;. This guided practice is oriented toward simply getting you familiar with the basic problem that motivates Dijkstra's Algorithm and the objects we use to study it. Discussion of the algorithm itself will be reserved for class time when we can struggle with it together -- although below I provide some resources if you want to learn more about it beforehand.</p>
<p>Before doing the exercises below, I recommend you do the following in order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In Section 9.6, read the introductory matter (pages 647--649) carefully. You can skim the rest for now.</li>
<li>Watch this basic video on how to create a weighted undirected graph in Sage using an edge list: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C9fNr7GpqM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C9fNr7GpqM</a>. You'll need this for class work on Monday and on upcoming learning modules.</li>
<li>Then watch this video on how to create a weighted undirected graph in Sage using an adjacency matrix: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1IrJjbH-I">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv1IrJjbH-I</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, here is a short function I wrote that generates a random undirected graph with random integer weights on it: <a href="https://gist.github.com/RobertTalbert/dcabefb27f3d6c5c6ca8">https://gist.github.com/RobertTalbert/dcabefb27f3d6c5c6ca8</a>. Instructions for use are in the comments at the beginning of the function. We will use this in class.</p>
<p>The above is sufficient to work the exerises and complete this assignment. However, here are some videos and web resources that go into Dijkstra's algorithm a little further, that you can either watch now, or come back to later once we've discussed the algorithm in class:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://optlab-server.sce.carleton.ca/POAnimations2007/DijkstrasAlgo.html">Animated web slide show of how Dijkstra's Algorithm works</a>. When it says a node is &quot;solved&quot;, that means &quot;visited&quot;.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdmfOwyQlcI">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> (5:01) You might want to watch this one twice to start to get a grasp on the process.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ls1RqHCOPw">Graphs: Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> (9:17) Another example using Dijkstra's Algorithm, this time using a directed graph.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UG7VmPWkJmA">Dijkstra's Algorithm example</a> (4:00) Yet another example. No sound other than Mozart. &quot;Removing&quot; a vertex means marking it as visited.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
<p>The activities below use the following weighted graph: <a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/tniqpxTOHju7">http://www.screencast.com/t/tniqpxTOHju7</a></p>
<p><a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/talbertr/folders/MTH%20325%20Images/media/41f114f4-864b-4086-9b54-df0086dc77ca/gp96.png"><img class="embeddedObject" src="http://content.screencast.com/users/talbertr/folders/MTH%20325%20Images/media/41f114f4-864b-4086-9b54-df0086dc77ca/gp96.png" width="384" height="375" border="0" /></a></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>There are several paths that begin at node 3 and end at node 6, but notice that they don't all &quot;cost&quot; the same. What is the total length -- that is, the total of all the weights -- of the path given by 3, 9, 11, 1, 8, 6?</li>
<li>Now consider the path 3, 9, 2, 5, 6. Although this has fewer edges than the previous path, it may not be &quot;shorter&quot; in the sense of having a lower total weight. Determine whether this path is &quot;shorter&quot; than the first one by calculating its total weight and comparing with the path in the first exercise.</li>
<li>You've compared two paths from 3 to 6 in the weighted graph, and one was shorter than the other (again -- in terms of total weight, not in terms of the number of edges). Does this mean that you have found the shortest possible path from 3 to 6? If not, why not?</li>
<li>If you were to try to construct the shortest path from 3 to 6 systematically, how do you think you would go about it? Starting from 3, where do you think you would go first? And then where would you go second?</li>
<li>General question not related to the examples above: Suppose a weighted graph has two nodes <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> and <span class="math"><em>b</em></span> that are connected by a single edge, and also by a path of length 10. Is it possible for the path of length 10 to be &quot;shorter&quot; than the path of length 1 given by the single edge? If so, explain how. If not, explain why not.</li>
