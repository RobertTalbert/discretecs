<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>We return in this lesson to graphs to relate them back to trees. Given a graph, we'd like to find a <em>spanning tree</em> for the graph -- a tree that has all the same nodes as the original graph but none of the cycles. Spanning trees are a &quot;skeleton&quot; of the original graph and provide a means of determining whether the graph is connected. Constructing a spanning tree in a graph involves two forms of <em>search</em> algorithms in the graph: <em>depth-first</em> and <em>breadth-first</em>, both of which are valuable applications in their own right.</p>
<h2 id="learning-objectives-in-this-section">Learning Objectives in this section</h2>
<ul>
<li>CC.34: State the definition of the term <em>spanning tree</em> and identify whether a subgraph of a given graph is or is not a spanning tree.</li>
<li>M.31 (CORE): Find a spanning tree within a graph using depth-first and breadth-first search.</li>
</ul>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Watch</strong> this 10-minute video that describes depth- and breadth-first search: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZhSSXAwxI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZhSSXAwxI</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Play</strong> with these two computer simulations: <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BFS.html">Breadth-first search</a>, <a href="https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html">Depth-first search</a>. On these, be sure to select &quot;undirected graph&quot;. You can slow down or speed up the animation using the slider at the <em>bottom</em> of the window, or step through the search process manually.</li>
<li><strong>Focus</strong> in the textbook on pages 724 through 725 (and the top of page 726) where there is a discussion of <em>spanning trees</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If after watching the video and playing with the simulations, you are still unclear on breadth- and depth-first searches, try doing a YouTube query for more video content (there is much more available); or searching Google for relevant text material such as lecture notes and handouts.</p>
<p>Finally: <strong>Skim</strong> the rest of Section 10.3 in the textbook for more descriptions of depth- and breadth-first search.</p>

<p>Here is a nice connected graph: <a href="http://content.screencast.com/users/talbertr/folders/MTH%20325%20Images/media/7d5f0bbe-c78d-4249-bff2-254c1937bf43/gp10-4.png"><img class="embeddedObject" src="http://content.screencast.com/users/talbertr/folders/MTH%20325%20Images/media/7d5f0bbe-c78d-4249-bff2-254c1937bf43/gp10-4.png" width="366" height="384" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>(<a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/uQvhInDmwwT">Direct link</a>)</p>
<p>By Theorem 1 of this section, since the graph is connected, it must have a spanning tree.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find a spanning tree for this graph that is obtained through a depth-first search starting at node 0. State your answer as a Python dictionary.</li>
<li>Find a spanning tree for this graph that is obtained through a breadth-first search starting at node 0. State your answer as a Python dictionary.</li>
<li>Unrelated to the graph above: Is it possible for a graph to have more than one possible spanning tree? If so, give an example of a graph and two spanning trees for it; keep the example as simple as you can. If not, explain why not.</li>
