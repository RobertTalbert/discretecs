For all positive integers $n$, if a set has $n$ elements, then the number of $2$-element subsets that is has is $n(n-1)/2$. 



For all integers $n \geq 1$, the number $5^n - 1$ is a multiple of $4$. 



For all integers $n \geq 1$, $1^2 + 2^2 + \cdots + n^2 = \dfrac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$. 



For all positive integers $n$, $1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1$. 



For all integers $n \geq 4$, $2^n < n!$. (Note: $n!$ is "$n$ factorial" which you learned in MTH 225)



For all integers $n \geq 1$, $6$ divides $n^3 - n$. 



For all positive integers $n$, $11^n - 6$ is divisible by $5$.

If $x$ is an even integer and $y$ is an odd integer, then $x+y$ is an odd integer. 



If $x$ is an even integer and $y$ is any other integer, then $xy$ is an even integer. 



If $x$ and $y$ are odd integers, then $x+y$ is an even integer. 



For every integer $n$ (positive, negative, or zero), if $n$ is an odd integer then $n^3$ is an odd integer. 



For every integer $n$ (positive, negative, or zero), if $n$ is a multiple of $4$ then $n^2 - 1$ is a multiple of $4$. 



If $S$ is a set with $n$ elements, then $S$ has $2^n$ subsets. 



If $S$ is a set with $n$ elements (and $n \geq 3$), then it has $\dfrac{n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n}{6}$  three-element subsets.
