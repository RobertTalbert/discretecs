# Conditional Statements and Direct Proof

## Statements and Conditional Statements

### What is a "statement"? 

In mathematics, a **statement** (or *proposition*) is **a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both**. Let's unpack that: 

- *Declarative sentence*: A statement makes an assertion about the truth of something. For example "All odd integers have a binary representation that ends in a 1" and "Detroit is the capital of Michigan" are both statements. But a sentence like "Detroit is a great place to visit" is not a statement (it's an opinion). Neither is a mathematical sentence like $x + 2 = 10$ because here, the truth of the sentence can't be determined because we don't know what $x$ is. It's true for some values of $x$ but not true for others. 
- *Either true or false but not both*: There can be no ambiguity in the truth value of a statement. For example "Detroit is the capital of Michigan" is definitely false. But "Detroit is a great place to visit" isn't really either true or false. 

### What is a "conditional statement"? 

A **conditional statement** is a statement that can be phrased in the form **"If $P$, then $Q$"** where $P$ and $Q$ are smaller, simpler statements. It is a statement in which there is a cause and an effect, and it claims that the effect follows from (or is "implied by") the cause. Here are some examples: 

- If $n$ is an even number, then $n^2$ is even. 
- If if is not raining, then I am riding my bike. 
- Whenever the input to $f(n)$ is even, the output is $n/2$. 
- An odd input to $f(n)$ implies that the output is $3n+1$. 
- The output is $3n+1$ when the input is odd. 

Notice that the wording of a conditional statement doesn't have to be literally "If...then". There just needs to be a cause and an effect. 

In mathematical notation, "If $P$ then $Q$" is written $P \rightarrow Q$. 

### What are the parts of a conditional statement? 

In the conditional statement "If $P$, then $Q$", the statement $P$ is the **hypothesis** and $Q$ is the **conclusion**. 

| Statement | Hypothesis | Conclusion | 
| -------- | -----------  | ----------- | 
| If $n$ is an even number, then $n^2$ is even. | $n$ is an even number | $n^2$ is even | 
| If if is not raining, then I am riding my bike. | It is not raining | I am riding my bike | 
| Whenever the input to $f(n)$ is even, the output is $n/2$. | The input to $f(n)$ is even | The output is $n/2$ | 
| The output is $3n+1$ when the input is odd. | The input is odd | The output is $3n+1$ | 

Notice: 

1. The hypothesis is not always simply the first statement you see in the sentence. (See the last example above.) The hypothesis is the "cause" and the conclusion is the "effect" that follows, regardless of where the wording places them in the sentence. 
2. We don't include the word "If" as part of the hypothesis, nor do we include the word "then" as part of the conclusion. 
 
### What does it mean for a conditional statement to be true? 

A conditional statement is "true" when **the conclusion follows from the hypothesis**. That is, 

### Under what conditions will a conditional statement be true? 

### What happens when the hypothesis of a conditional statement is false?
