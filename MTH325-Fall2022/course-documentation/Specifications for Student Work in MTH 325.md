# Specifications for Student Work in MTH 325

**This document contains all the details for what constitutes "successful" or "acceptable" work on each type of assignment in the course**. Use the table of contents in the upper-left to navigate to specific assignment types, and use this document to check your work for correctness before submitting it. 

## Daily Prep 

Daily Prep assignments are graded on the basis of **completeness and good-faith effort**. Correctness is not taken into account; but a good-faith effort to *try* to be correct must be evident. 

| The work receives a mark of... | If it meets these criteria: | 
| :----: | ---- | 
| **Completed** | <ul><li>The assignment is submitted by the deadline, *and*</li><li>Every item on the response form has a response, *and*</li><li>There is at least one substantive question, comment, or comment reply on Perusall for either the text or a video</li></ul>
| **Not Completed** | One or more of the standards is not met: The assignment is late; or there is an item on the response form that is blank (even if by accident); or there is no substantive engagement with the reading and viewing on Perusall. |

## Content Skill Standards 

There are three different ways to demonstrate skill on a Content Skill Standard: By working a problem on a  quiz, by working a problem in an oral quiz in drop-in hours, and by working a problem recorded to a video. 

Individual demonstrations of skill on a Content Skill Standard, regardless of the method, either meet the standards for success given below, or they do not. **The result of an individual attempt is not recorded on Blackboard; instead that information is given in the feedback on the item.** 

Demonstrations of skill on **written and oral quizzes** are graded on the basis of *completeness and correctness*. 

| The demonstration is... | If it meets these criteria: | 
| :----: | ---- | 
| **Successful** | <ul><li>Each part of the problem has a good-faith attempt at a response, *and*</li><li>The response contains **no more than two simple errors**, and **no non-simple errors**, *and*</li><li>Unless specifically stated otherwise, the response must show all the significant steps used to arrive at the answers.</li></ul>
| **Not successful** | Not all the standards for "Successful" are met. |

**What is a "simple error"?** For MTH 325, a "simple" error is defined to be an error in logic, computation, or communication that *does not pertain to the learning target* and *does not oversimplify the problem*. 

For example, suppose you are finding a minimum spanning tree for a weighted graph (Content Skill Standard G.7) and one of the edge weights is "12" but you accidentally copy it down as "2" in your work. As long as you go ahead and find the minimum spanning tree correctly with this incorrect information, the copy error is a "simple" error because it doesn't show evidence of any issues in your understanding of the standard, and replacing the 12 with a 2 doesn't make the problem any easier. On the other hand, if you "miscopied" *every* edge as having weight 2, then this is not "simple" because it makes the problem trivial -- it is no longer a legitimate source of information about your ability with the standard.  

**Remember that only two simple errors are allowed on any Content Skill Standard problem.** Having three or more simple errors indicates that a retry is in order to apply more careful attention to the attempt. So **always double-check your work when possible**, and **proofread your solutions before submitting them**.  
:::


**Video solutions** are graded similarly to written and oral quizzes, but there is an additional criterion for *technical quality* of the video: 

| The demonstration is... | If it meets these criteria: | 
| :----: | ---- | 
| **Successful** | <ul><li>All the standards for "Successful" shown above are met, *and*</li><li>The video is less than 5 minutes in length, *and*</li><li>Your face, voice, and handwriting are simultaneously in the frame at all times, *and*</li><li>The handwriting is legible and both the video and audio are clear.</li></ul>
| **Retry** | Not all the standards for "Successful" are met. | 


## Proof and Application problems

Proof and Application problems both involve writing and communication in addition to mathematical (and sometimes programming) work. A right answer is not enough on these; **the primary criteria for evaluation are the correctness of your *solution* and whether you communicate your ideas clearly and thoroughly**. 

:::info
Note: **The audience for all Proof and Application problem solutions is your classmates** --- people who have the background mathematical knowledge that you have, but who have no familiarity with the problem you are working on. **Prof. Talbert is not the audience, and neither are you** --- so don't assume that the person reading the solution has a Ph.D. or has been studying the problem for a while. 
::: 

Proof and Application problems are marked either *Successful* or *Revise*. **To be marked *Successful*, a solution to a problem must fulfill all of the criteria below:**
