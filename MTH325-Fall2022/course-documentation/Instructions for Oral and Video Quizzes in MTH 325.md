# Instructions for Oral and Video Quizzes in MTH 325

As outlined in the syllabus, you can give a successful demonstration of skill on a Content Skill Standard not only through work on a quiz problem, but also: 

- Through attempting an **oral quiz** during drop-in hours, and 
- Through a **video quiz** where you work out a problem while recording yourself. 

This document gives instructions on how to go about these two methods of demonstrating skill. 

## How to do an oral quiz in drop-in hours

In an oral quiz, you'll request a Content Skill Standard to attempt, then come to drop-in hours. I'll then give you a new problem on that standard similar to ones that are on written quizzes. You'll work it out on a whiteboard, and then we will discuss how it went and whether it was a successful demonstration of skill or not. 

To do an oral quiz: 

1. **Schedule a time in drop-in hours** so that I'll know in advance that you are coming, and which standard you want to try. For in-person oral quizzes, use this link: https://calendly.com/robert-talbert/mth-325-inperson-oral-quiz-request You can also do a live, online oral quiz during drop-in hours; sign up for this using this link: https://calendly.com/robert-talbert/mth-325-online-oral-quiz-request 
2. On the sign-up form, it will give you a choice of **15-minute** time slots. Pick any one time slot that works for you. 
3. The sign-up form also asks which Content Skill Standard you wish to attempt. Note that **you may attempt only one Standard per oral quiz** and you will have 15 minutes in which to complete the attempt. 
4. Once you have filled out the sign-up form, make a note of the date and time in your calendar. If you request an online oral quiz, you will receive a Zoom link as well. **If you are late for the appointment for your quiz, you will not get extra time!** 
5. From there it's simple -- just show up (in person or at the Zoom link you were sent). I'll prepare a new problem for the standard you chose, and you'll work on it. Then we'll discuss the results together. 

As a reminder [from the syllabus](https://hackmd.io/@rtalbert235/S1o7qHYR5): 

- You may only request one oral quiz per week. This includes requests for oral quizzes that result in missed appointments. 
- No requests for oral quizzes will be accepted after 11:59pm ET on Sunday December 4. 

## How to do a video quiz 

A video quiz is an asynchronous option for attempting Content Skill Standards. You simply ask for a problem for a particular standard. I'll send you one. Then, you work out your solution at a whiteboard while you or a friend records you while you work. 

To do a video quiz: 

1. **Email me** (talbertr@gvsu.edu) to let me know that you want to do a video quiz and which Content Skill Standard you wish to attempt. As noted in the syllabus, **only one Content Skill Standard per video quiz may be attempted.** 
2. I will reply to that email with a new problem for that standard. 
3. Work out the solution to that problem on paper, without recording yourself first so that you can be sure you have a correct solution. Then practice presenting that solution. 
4. When you are ready, find a quiet space where you can present your work. Having a whiteboard helps --- for example you might find an empty classroom, one of the study rooms in the library, or your apartment or dorm space using a portable whiteboard. 
5. Join the "MTH 325 Content Skill Standard videos" group on **Flipgrid**, using the link http://flip.com/4c1a7e9d. Flipgrid (also known as "Flip") is the platform we will use for uploading your Content Skill Standard video quiz recordings. 
6. Download and install the **Flipgrid** app on your phone or tablet. ([Link to Plauy Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vidku.app.flipgrid&hl=en_US&gl=US); link to [Apple Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flip-share-discover-be-you/id756972930)) The app is currently undergoing a name change from "Flipgrid" to "Flip", so you might see it listed under the new name instead. 
7. From the Flipgrid app, **record yourself as you work through the problem you were sent** --- like you were making a social media video of your work. (Don't worry, I am *not* going to post these online! The Flipgrid group is private, and only you and I can see your work.) If you make a mistake, it's OK to start over. Once you have a video you are happy with, upload it to the group on Flipgrid. 
8. From there, I will leave feedback on the video, including whether it's a successful attempt or not. 

A few notes and reminders about video quizzes: 

- As noted above, you may request only **one video quiz per week**, and only **one Content Skill Standard per request**. 
- No requests for video quizzes will be accepted after 11:59pm ET on Sunday, December 4. 
- You may not request a video quiz if you have requested one earlier but not completed the video yet. 
- Video quizzes have three additional requirements for a "successful attempt" beyond the usual requirements: The video must be **less than 5 minutes long**; you must keep your **voice, handwriting, and face in the video at all times** (to prevent cheating); and your **video, audio, and handwriting must be easy to understand**. Videos that don't meet these requirements will be considered unsuccessful attempts, and you'll have to redo them. *Pay particular attention to the time limit and practice your presentation to get it under 5 minutes*. 
- It's OK to have a friend record you while you work. However, all other points about academic honest are in full effect: You are to treat a video quiz just like a written quiz in terms of resources you can use.
