# MTH 325 Fall 2022 Assessment, Marking, and Feedback

## Assessments

- There are 20 content skill standards (or just content skills or just content standards). A standard is "met" once a student provides two successful demonstrations of skill. 
  - Through content standard quizzes, given periodically in class; consisting of problems, one standard per problem; cumulative through the semester. 
  - Or through doing an oral content standard quiz, available in person or on Zoom by request. 
  - Or through making a video of a custom quiz problem, available upon request and posted privately to Flipgrid. 
- Each (nearly each) class has Daily Prep: 
  - Reading, viewing, and/or experiments to run. Reading and viewing coordinated through Perusall. 
  - Assignment is always to leave a substantive comment on Perusall and then answer questions on a Google Form. 
  - Graded on the basis of completeness and effort. They will remain open until they are graded, the morning of the class. Never graded before 11:59pm ET. 1 point for complete good-faith effort. 
- Proof badge 
  - See document on content standards for what this involves
  - Proof problems posted in a running document, populated at the beginning of the semester; submit proofs typed up as PDFs. Get feedback; no grades on these, just feedback, in a loop until I tell you that it's good to go. 
- Applications badge 
  - See document on content standards for what this involves
  - Application problems posted off and on through the semester as we cover content. Write up solutions in a PDF. Get feedback; no grades on these, just feedback, in a loop until I tell you that it's good to go. 


## Marking 

- Content standards: 
  - One column per standard in the gradebook
  - Each *individual demonstration* is marked with a check if it's successful or X if not, feedback given
  - Each *standard* marked in the gradebook with 0, 1, or 2 representing the *number of successful attempts so far*. See individual submissions for the latest one. 
- Daily Prep: Marked Check or X 
- Nothing else is marked. 
  - Essay for the badges will include an inventory of which proofs/application problems you want considered. 

## Feedback 

- Feedback on proofs and application problems comes on the PDF. 
- No feedback on Daily Prep but answers discussed in class. 
- Keys posted for Skill quizzes; feedback given if needed on the PDF.
