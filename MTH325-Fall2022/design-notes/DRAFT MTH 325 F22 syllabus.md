## About the course and this syllabus

Welcome to MTH 325! I'm Dr. Robert Talbert, the professor of this course. I'm grateful you're here, and I think you're going to love what you learn this semester. MTH 325 really gets into the *structures* part of Discrete Structures by looking at three fundamental constructs that are everywhere in math and CS: **graphs**, **relations**, and **trees**. We'll be learning all about these, and also learning how to think rigorously about these structures through the use of **proof**. 

This syllabus contains all the information you need to navigate the course. It is available in an online format as well as a PDF. Both versions will be updated weekly. 

When you see blue- or purple-underlined text in the syllabus or any other document, it's a clickable link. For example, [click here for a cat video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFuUidBR1aQ).

**This document is meant to be read once, then searched as needed.** If you need to find something, you can either use the table of contents found in the left sidebar of the web version (click "Expand All" to see the subsections in the table) or  hit `Control-F` to bring up a search field, and then type in the text you are looking for.

## Success in MTH 325 

**My commitment to your success:** My top prority as a professor at GVSU is your success. In MTH 325, you can expect:

- A learning environment that challenges you, but also where support is readily available and freely given. This class is *a safe space to make mistakes*. 
- Transparency and openness in how the course is run, including clear instructions on what you need to do and when. 
- Openness to your ideas about the course, with regular solicitations for feedback that are taken seriously through a continuous improvement process. 
- Work that is meaningful and not "busy work", and grading practices that prioritize growth and improvement. 
- Above all, **respect** -- for you as a learner, as an adult, and as a human. 

On your end, your success in the course depends on three things: 

1. **Active engagement during class time**. All the available research on learning says that the only way to learn is to be an active participant in the process. Make it a priority not to just attend and take notes, but *get involved*. Students who approach the class with a passive mindset typically struggle, and often fail. Those who approach it with an active mindset, on the other hand, often surprise themselves with how much and how well they learn. 
2. **Asking questions**. The material in MTH 325 is challenging, and it is 100% certain you will  be lost, confused, and/or stuck at times. **This is not a defect -- it means you're doing the course right.** When it happens, don't wait for things to make sense on their own: *Ask questions* of me and your classmates and take action to make sense of the material. 
3. **Good management of time, tasks, and information.** Understanding the material won't help you if you procrastinate, skip reading announcements, or don't use a calendar. All course information will be clearly laid out for you, but it's up to you to import that information into your own lives and act on it. 

If you can commit to these three things, then I have every expectation that you'll succeed in the course, no matter what your math background or perceived math skill is. 


## How MTH 325 is structured 

### Course level learning objectives and catalog description

The overall goal of MTH 225 and MTH 325 is to build a solid foundation in the basic theory and tools for the mathematics that computer science is built on, especially the theory and tools you will need for later coursework such as MTH 325 and CIS 263.

After successful completion of MTH 325, you will be able toâ€¦
- Compute basic information about graphs, relations, and trees.
- Solve theoretical and applied problems involving applications of basic concepts of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Formulate computational problems in terms of graphs, relations, and trees.
- Construct a logical framework for a proof using mathematical induction, direct proof, proof by contraposition, or proof by contradiction.
- Analyze the structure and validity of a mathematical proof.
- Employ effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
- Explain methods and solutions of computational problems in a clear way to a specified target audience.
- Demonstrate fluency in applying algorithms in the formulation and solutions of mathematical problems.
- Assess one's own work in mathematical problem solving and apply feedback to make improvements to one's own work.

### Module structure and content standards

The course content is split up into four modules: 

- **Module 1: Proof.** The concept of proof, examples, and counterexamples; review of (weak) mathematical induction; strong induction; structural induction; direct proof; proof by contrapositive; indirect proof. 
- **Module 2: Graphs.** Terminology and examples of graphs; representation of graphs in computer languages; the Handshaking Theorem; Euler and Hamilton paths and cycles; isomorphism; vertex coloring; minimal spanning trees.
- **Module 3: Digraphs and relations.** Terminology of directed graphs and relations; representation of relations in computer languages; properties of relations; composition of relations; transitive closure and Warshall's algorithm; equivalence relations; partial orderings.
- **Module 4: Trees.** Terminology and examples of trees; properties of trees; binary search trees; tree traversals. 

The most important skills that you will learn in the course are housed in a list of 20 **Content Skill Standards**, found in Appendix A. 


### The MTH 325 Workflow 

Each class meeting has activities for you to do *before*, *during* and *after* the class. For details on specific assignment types, see the next section.

- **Before class:** You'll be asked to complete a **Daily Prep** assignment where you'll do a combination of reading, video viewing, and other activities then answering basic questions about it. This way, you'll come to class ready to work, and we can skip the lecturing in class unless it's really needed.
- **During class:** Class meetings will be focused on *answering questions* and *doing active work*. We'll also use time in class for assessment and for completing other assignments. We will *not* be doing much lecturing in class, unless it's something quick and targeted at specific questions from your Daily Prep. 
- **After class:** In addition to getting started on the next Daily Prep, you should expect to spend significant time in between classes doing practice on concepts you don't fully understand yet, asking questions, and working on Proof or Applications problems. 


## Assessments and marking 

### Overall philosophy of grading in MTH 325 

### Four kinds of assessments in MTH 325

- Daily prep
- Content Skill Standards 
- Proofs
- Applications

### How these are graded 

- Table with assessments, basis for evaluation, what's recorded 
- Link to specifications document 
- All work other than Daily Prep can be revised, redone, and/or resubmitted if you aren't happy with the result; see below 

### More about Content Skill Standards

- Show you have mastered a CSS by *demonstrating skill*
- How this works: 
  - Quizzes
  - Oral quizzes in drop-in hours
  - Video quizzes 
- A demonstration of skill is "successful" if it meets the success criteria listed in the document on specifications 
- To meet a content skill standard, you need TWO successful demonstrations of skill, with at least one of those demonstrations coming from a quiz. 
- What's recorded
  - On the individual demonstration itself: Either a "check mark" or not
  - On Blackboard: "Met", "One DOS", or "No DOS yet" showing how many DOSs have been done so far 
- Example of two different ways 

### More on Proof and Application problems 

*Flesh this out a little more later after getting details on what they'll do*

- How to submit work 
- Limitations on number of submissions per week 
- What happens once you submit work
  - "1" is recorded to indicate successful submission. "0" means there was a problem, see email 
  - No mark otherwise is given
  - Just feedback and you will be told explicitly when the work is good enough 

### Wait: no points, partial credit, or averages? 

- Yep
- Why no points, why no partial credit
- What you get instead
  - Instead of points, a clear yes/no as to whether the work is good enough
  - Space to make mistakes thanks to revision process 
  - Grade will actually indicate your understanding 

## Course grades 

- Table 
- Blurb about +/-
- Important points: 
  - No points so no partial credit -- get revisions instead 
  - No points so no averaging -- cannot make up for poor work in one area by better work in another 
  - Lots of choice 


## Revision and resubmission

- Daily Preps cannot be revised 
- How to "revise" content skill standards
  - Taking subsequent quizzes 
  - Trying again 

## Academic integrity and honesty

- What is academic integrity
- What happens if you violate university policies
- What's allowed for each kind of assignment


## Getting help 

As mentioned, you will almost certainly find yourself lost, stuck, or confused on *something* in this course, possibly quite often. This is not a defect in your character or intelligence; it's a sign you are being challenged, and you can turn that challenge into real growth by **seeking out help as soon as you need it**. 

Make every effort to get yourself unstuck and resolve your questions on your own first. But then: 

* **Attend drop-in hours and ask questions there.** You can use the in-person drop-in hours, the online ones, or both. No appointment needed. 
* [Schedule an appointment through Calendly](https://calendly.com/robert-talbert/) if drop-in hours don't work for you. 
* **Work with a classmate** especially on Daily Prep, as long as you're staying within bounds on academic honesty.

## Course policies

### Attendance, absences and participation

**Attendance:** Attenance is expected at all class meetings. Attendance is recorded so I can have a record of it and reach out to see if you're OK if you miss several classes; but it is not graded, nor does it count in your final grade. 

**Remote attendance:** Class meetings will be live-streamed on Zoom and recorded. If you cannot be physically present for class, you can access the recording at any point within 30 days of the class. You may join the Zoom meeting if you can't be present, but my attention will be focused on those who are present; you won't be able to work with others, and if you leave questions in the chat I may not see them until 

**Absences:** If you must be absent, you do not need prior permission or justification; a heads-up is appreciated. However *please avoid any non-essential absences* such as skipping class, or scheduling a vacation during a day where class is scheduled. If you miss, you are solely responsible for catching up. 

**Missing Content Skill Standard quizzes:** There is no makeup available if you miss Content Skill Standard quizzes in class. These are begun in class but completed outside of class, so missing the in-class time for working on them should not affect you. 


### Deadlines and late work 

- Daily Preps are due by 11:59pm on the day it says; late work is accepted up until the point that I sit down to grade them, which could happen at any point between 5am and noon
- Same is true for Content Standard quizzes 
- Proof and Application problems will have soft deadlines on them -- give a thing about deadlines 

### Technology skills and support

- Don't ask me for tech support
- List of support numbers
- If tech issues prevent submission of work 

### Instructor availability and message responses

You have a right and the responsibility to ask a question about anything you don't fully understand, at any time. To ask me questions, you can use email (talbertr@gvsu.edu), the course Padlet, or drop-in hours or appointments.

I do not always respond to all messages immediately because I have to prioritize a number of tasks throughout the week that make demands on my time; and I do not leave my email open all day.

I typically respond to email and Padlet posts once per day in the late afternoon. If you send a message on a weekday (Monday through Friday) before 4:00pm ET, it will get a same-day response. Messages sent after 4:00pm on Fridays or on the weekends will get a response no later than the following Monday afternoon. Please note: If you have a significant question over a weekend, your best bet is to post it to the course Padlet where it will be seen by the entire class, so you might get an answer before Monday.

### Special accommodations and basic needs 

If you have special needs because of learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at (616)331-2490 or http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/. DSR will help you arrange accommodations. Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit Replenish, a food resource for GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.

If, for purposes of gender identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.
