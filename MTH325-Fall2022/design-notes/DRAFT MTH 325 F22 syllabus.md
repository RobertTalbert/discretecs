## Assessments and marking 

### Overall philosophy of grading in MTH 325 

### Four kinds of assessments in MTH 325

- Daily prep
- Content Skill Standards 
- Proofs
- Applications

### How these are graded 

- Table with assessments, basis for evaluation, what's recorded 
- Link to specifications document 
- All work other than Daily Prep can be revised, redone, and/or resubmitted if you aren't happy with the result; see below 

### More about Content Skill Standards

- Show you have mastered a CSS by *demonstrating skill*
- How this works: 
  - Quizzes
  - Oral quizzes in drop-in hours
  - Video quizzes 
- A demonstration of skill is "successful" if it meets the success criteria listed in the document on specifications 
- To meet a content skill standard, you need TWO successful demonstrations of skill, with at least one of those demonstrations coming from a quiz. 
- What's recorded
  - On the individual demonstration itself: Either a "check mark" or not
  - On Blackboard: "Met", "One DOS", or "No DOS yet" showing how many DOSs have been done so far 
- Example of two different ways 

### More on Proof and Application problems 

*Flesh this out a little more later after getting details on what they'll do*

- How to submit work 
- Limitations on number of submissions per week 
- What happens once you submit work
  - "1" is recorded to indicate successful submission. "0" means there was a problem, see email 
  - No mark otherwise is given
  - Just feedback and you will be told explicitly when the work is good enough 

### Wait: no points, partial credit, or averages? 

- Yep
- Why no points, why no partial credit
- What you get instead
  - Instead of points, a clear yes/no as to whether the work is good enough
  - Space to make mistakes thanks to revision process 
  - Grade will actually indicate your understanding 

## Course grades 

- Table 
- Blurb about +/-
- Important points: 
  - No points so no partial credit -- get revisions instead 
  - No points so no averaging -- cannot make up for poor work in one area by better work in another 
  - Lots of choice

- How to "revise" content skill standards

## Course policies

### Attendance, absences and participation

- Attendance is recorded but not graded -- will reach out if there's a pattern
- Attending remotely
- Absences
- Content standard quizzes: We start them in class and then they are due by 11:59pm the same day; if you miss class, you can still do them
- Participation expected 


### Deadlines and late work 

- Daily Preps are due by 11:59pm on the day it says; late work is accepted up until the point that I sit down to grade them, which could happen at any point between 5am and noon
- Same is true for Content Standard quizzes 
- Proof and Application problems will have soft deadlines on them -- give a thing about deadlines

### Instructor availability and message responses

You have a right and the responsibility to ask a question about anything you don't fully understand, at any time. To ask me questions, you can use email (talbertr@gvsu.edu), the course Padlet, or drop-in hours or appointments.

I do not always respond to all messages immediately because I have to prioritize a number of tasks throughout the week that make demands on my time; and I do not leave my email open all day.

I typically respond to email and Padlet posts once per day in the late afternoon. If you send a message on a weekday (Monday through Friday) before 4:00pm ET, it will get a same-day response. Messages sent after 4:00pm on Fridays or on the weekends will get a response no later than the following Monday afternoon. Please note: If you have a significant question over a weekend, your best bet is to post it to the course Padlet where it will be seen by the entire class, so you might get an answer before Monday.

### Special accommodations and basic needs 

If you have special needs because of learning, physical or other disabilities, it is your responsibility to contact Disability Support Resources (DSR) at (616)331-2490 or http://www.gvsu.edu/dsr/. DSR will help you arrange accommodations. Then, speak with me in person about making those accommodations and ensure that they are consistent with your arrangements with DSR.

If you have difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or if you lack a safe and stable place to live, I encourage you to visit Replenish, a food resource for GVSU students. If you are comfortable doing so, please speak with me about your circumstances so that I can advocate for you and to connect you with other campus resources.

If, for purposes of gender identity and expression, your official name (in Banner) does not match your preferred name, your name can be updated in Blackboard. Please contact the registrar's office to submit this request. The registrar's office will contact the Blackboard administrator to make the change and will also contact your professors to inform them that your name in Banner will not match the name in Blackboard.
