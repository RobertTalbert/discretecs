# Lesson Level Objectives for MTH 325

## Review

- Given a conditional statement: 
  - State the hypothesis and conclusion
  - State the converse, contrapositive, and negation
  - State the conditions under which it's true
- Given a statement to be proven using mathematical induction (weak): 
  - State and prove the base case
  - State the inductive hypothesis
  - State what needs to be proven in the proof step, and provide useful thoughts on how to do it  
- 

## Proof

- Given a statement to be proven using mathematical induction (of any flavor): 
  - State and prove the base case
  - State the inductive hypothesis
  - State what needs to be proven in the proof step, and provide useful thoughts on how to do it 
- Explain the differences between weak, strong, and structural induction and when each method of proof is appropriate. 
- Given a conditional statement to prove, determine whether direct, indirect, or contrapositive is the best approach
- Given a statement to be proven using direct proof: 
  - Identify the assumptions and the goal 
  - Write the first and last lines of the proof
  - Perform "forward" and "backward" steps
  - Write a well-written completed proof 
- Given a statement to be proven using contradiction: 
  - State the assumptions 
  - Outline a proof that arrives at a contradiction and identity the contradiction
  - Write a well-written completed proof
- Given a written proof: 
  - Identify the form of proof being used
  - Analyze its structure
  - Perform a "critical analysis" (determine whether the proposition itself is true or false; determine if the proof is correct and find critical errors; if the proof is correct and free of critical errors, give suggestions for stylistic improvement)


## Graphs

- State the definition of a graph
- Represent a graph in different ways 
  - As a pair (V,E) of vertices and edges 
  - As a picture
  - ==As a Python dictionary==

## Relations

## Trees
