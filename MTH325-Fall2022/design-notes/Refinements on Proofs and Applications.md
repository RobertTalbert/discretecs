# Refinements on Proofs and Applications

**Logistics**: Post all the proof problems in a running Markdown document and set up individual assignment folders in Bb. For applications, post in separate documents attached to their folders. When students submit one, mark as "Waiting" or "Evaluated"; will need to loop through daily and set these. 

## Proof problems

- A number of proof problems will be assigned in weeks 1-2 of the class with more to come later. 
- You pick which ones you want to do. 
- Once you pick one, write up a full proof (along with a reflection at the end) and submit it: By converting it to PDF and uploading to the designated assignment folder on Bb. 
  - Must be typewritten
  - Must be Word or PDF 
- Reflection: Write a little about how you approached the problem, what you tried, and if it's a revision what you realized and how you changed your work 
- I will go through daily and evaluate whatever is sitting there. 
- The submission does not get a mark/grade! Just feedback on what you're doing well and what still needs some work. You may need to revise in order to bring it up to the standards for proof in the course. If that's the case, it'll say so and you'll get some direction on what to do. 
- Please note, I may not catch all issues when I evaluate because sometimes one error can obscure others. So revising one error can reveal an error that was there in an earlier draft. 
- If the work meets the standard, it'll say so, and you're done, but keep the work. 
- You are responsible for assembling a small portfolio of your proof work to earn the "Proof badge"
  -  Requires proofs of different types, all meeting standards
  -  Also requires meeting some proof based CSSs 
  -  And a reflection at the end
- Completing the Proof badge: 
  - Meet all three "P" content skill standards 
  - Submit three (*used to be four, keep it there?*) proofs: One must use some form of induction, one that doesn't, and the third free choice 
  - A reflection essay 
- You can complete this badge at any time in the course. 


## Application problems

- Like proofs, these will be posted during the semester. Planning on 4-8 of these overall, with some focused just on Python programming. 
- Like proofs: Pick the ones you want to do and do them, then submit them. Upload to appropriate Bb folder
- Unlike proofs, these will be more spread out with new application problems coming up as we cover more content 
- Evaluation and marking works the same as proofs 
- Completing the Applications badge: 
  - Completion of Codecademy Python course 
  - Complete three different Application Problems, at least one of which is a programming problem 
  - Reflection essay 


## Brainstorming how to submit

Email vs. Blackboard

- Email
  - Pros: 
    - Students definitely know when something's been evaluated and ready for revision because they get a message
    - Keeps people off Blackboard 
  - Cons:
    - Students have to keep track of the responses and versions
- Blackboard
  - Pros: 
    - All versions there in the same place for comparison
    - Keeps everything in one place and doesn't require students to track
  - Cons: 
    - Annotation tools not as good
    - Requires making a separate assignment folder for every problem


Overall Bb looks better from the student standpoint but I wish there were a better way.
