# MTH 325 Planning 

## Step 0

+ Who
    - There are 24 students in Section 03 and 14 students in Section 04 as of 2022-07-27
    - The students in MTH 325 are primarily CS majors
        - Section 03: All CS except for one music (!) major; mostly jr/sr
        - Section 04: All CS so far, 8/14 are sophomores which is unusual
    - A number of repeat customers from 225
    - Typically a bunch of these students have taken CIS 263 (algorithms) so there's some overlap with graph theory
    - They've all had MTH 225 so they have a decent understanding of what discrete math is, but might need a refresher 
    - Goals -- IDK but many are fairly far along in their careers and close to graduation. Probably means they don't want a lot of hassle, and are taking some advanced classes, projects, internships, etc. 
    - Stakeholders: 
        - School of CIS 
        - Graduate schools into which they are going
        - Employers 
    - About me
        - Coming back into F2F teaching after a while online
        - Letting go of aspirations to leadership positions and doubling down on teaching and research, or at least exploring that space
        - So I am curious to try out new stuff, but also I am aware of not overloading myself since I want to focus less on work 
        - Plenty of experience with the 225-325 sequence but my first time back with 325 since 2017 and first time teaching since the redesign that puts proof in the first 1/4 of the course 
+ What
    - Topic areas: Proof -> Graphs -> Relations -> Trees. 
    - Some overarching narratives
        - Using various flavors of graph structures to model and analyze relationships 
        - Reasoning about algorithms for graphs and related structures -- drawing conclusions about these without writing code 
        - Many have already seen the material from the CS and coding side; we are now looking at the same material from the theoretical/math POV. 
        - Learning how to reason about discrete structures independently of code, learning how to think like mathematicians
        - Computational thinking applied to graph structures 
    - Proof is introduced and practiced early, but most of what we learn is woven in through the course. 
    - Creative control: Basically I have total control over the course as long as it vaguely resembles the SOR. 
+ When
    - Classes start on Aug 29, end on Friday Dec 9. 
    - From today: 33 days away. 
    - 41 meeting days not counting planned absences 
    - Planned absences: 
        - Maybe Wed 9/7 and Friday 9/9 (Apple HQ trip) 
        - Friday 10/7 for LHE conference
        - Wed 11/2 for EdSpaces conference 
    - For a total of between 37 and 39 meetings (maybe get a sub for the later ones). 
    - 15 weeks not counting Fall Break or Thanksgiving. 
    - We meet MWF. Section 03 is 12-12:50 and Section 04 is 2-2:50. 
    - Note: Need to make sure there won't be any issues with UAS/ECS
+ Where
    - Both sections meet in D2329 for the time being but I am requesting a move to an ALC 
    - It's F2F but I might try live-streaming the meetings so I can record them, and they're available for those who can't make it
+ Why
    - This course exists... well, I'm not sure why since there's so much overlap with CIS 263 and others. But in my view: It exists to help CS people think like mathematicians about structures and systems that underly the code they write. Physics:Architecture :: MTH325:CS. 
    - I am teaching the course because I like it, I like working with CS majors, because it was avaialble on a good schedule, and because I'm making a larger shift in my teaching to focus on engineering and CS courses, less so on theoretical math and math ed courses. 
    - I am excited to get back to MTH 325 because I've always liked it, and it's been a while since I did it. Feel like I have learned a lot in the last five years in terms of structuring the course and managing the various innovations I employ.
