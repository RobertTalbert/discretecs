# MTH 325 Planning 

## Step 0

+ Who
    - There are 24 students in Section 03 and 14 students in Section 04 as of 2022-07-27
    - The students in MTH 325 are primarily CS majors
        - Section 03: All CS except for one music (!) major; mostly jr/sr
        - Section 04: All CS so far, 8/14 are sophomores which is unusual
    - A number of repeat customers from 225
    - Typically a bunch of these students have taken CIS 263 (algorithms) so there's some overlap with graph theory
    - They've all had MTH 225 so they have a decent understanding of what discrete math is, but might need a refresher 
    - Goals -- IDK but many are fairly far along in their careers and close to graduation. Probably means they don't want a lot of hassle, and are taking some advanced classes, projects, internships, etc. 
    - Stakeholders: 
        - School of CIS 
        - Graduate schools into which they are going
        - Employers 
    - About me
        - Coming back into F2F teaching after a while online
        - Letting go of aspirations to leadership positions and doubling down on teaching and research, or at least exploring that space
        - So I am curious to try out new stuff, but also I am aware of not overloading myself since I want to focus less on work 
        - Plenty of experience with the 225-325 sequence but my first time back with 325 since 2017 and first time teaching since the redesign that puts proof in the first 1/4 of the course 
+ What
    - Topic areas: Proof -> Graphs -> Relations -> Trees. 
    - Some overarching narratives
        - Using various flavors of graph structures to model and analyze relationships 
        - Reasoning about algorithms for graphs and related structures -- drawing conclusions about these without writing code 
        - Many have already seen the material from the CS and coding side; we are now looking at the same material from the theoretical/math POV. 
        - Learning how to reason about discrete structures independently of code, learning how to think like mathematicians
        - Computational thinking applied to graph structures 
    - Proof is introduced and practiced early, but most of what we learn is woven in through the course. 
    - Creative control: Basically I have total control over the course as long as it vaguely resembles the SOR. 
+ When
    - Classes start on Aug 29, end on Friday Dec 9. 
    - From today: 33 days away. 
    - 41 meeting days not counting planned absences 
    - Planned absences: 
        - Maybe Wed 9/7 and Friday 9/9 (Apple HQ trip) 
        - Friday 10/7 for LHE conference
        - Wed 11/2 for EdSpaces conference 
    - For a total of between 37 and 39 meetings (maybe get a sub for the later ones). 
    - 15 weeks not counting Fall Break or Thanksgiving. 
    - We meet MWF. Section 03 is 12-12:50 and Section 04 is 2-2:50. 
    - Note: Need to make sure there won't be any issues with UAS/ECS
+ Where
    - Both sections meet in D2329 for the time being but I am requesting a move to an ALC 
    - It's F2F but I might try live-streaming the meetings so I can record them, and they're available for those who can't make it
+ Why
    - This course exists... well, I'm not sure why since there's so much overlap with CIS 263 and others. But in my view: It exists to help CS people think like mathematicians about structures and systems that underly the code they write. Physics:Architecture :: MTH325:CS. 
    - I am teaching the course because I like it, I like working with CS majors, because it was avaialble on a good schedule, and because I'm making a larger shift in my teaching to focus on engineering and CS courses, less so on theoretical math and math ed courses. 
    - I am excited to get back to MTH 325 because I've always liked it, and it's been a while since I did it. Feel like I have learned a lot in the last five years in terms of structuring the course and managing the various innovations I employ.

## Overarching course objectives

Course objectives from the [syllabus of record](https://www.gvsu.edu/cms4/asset/9A420BCF-BA9E-0845-91754145EA82C51F/sor_descriptions_objectives__topics_for_faculty_updated_12-11-19.pdf)

1. Compute basic information about graphs, relations, and trees.
2. Solve theoretical and applied problems involving applications of basic concepts of graphs, relations, and trees.
3. Formulate computational problems in terms of graphs, relations, and trees.
4. Construct a logical framework for a proof using mathematical induction, direct proof, proof by contraposition, or proof by contradiction.
5. Analyze the structure and validity of a mathematical proof.
6. Employ effective problem-solving skills in solving computational problems.
7. Explain methods and solutions of computational problems in a clear way to a specified target audience.
8. Demonstrate fluency in applying algorithms in the formulation and solutions of mathematical problems.
9. Assess one's own work in mathematical problem solving and apply feedback to make improvements to one's own work.


## Subdivision of the course into modules 

- Module 0: Startup and review. This is just getting set up and fluent in course tools; *maybe* Python; and a quick review of what happened in MTH 225. 
- Module 1: Proof
- Module 2: Graphs
- Module 3: Relations
- Module 4: Trees
