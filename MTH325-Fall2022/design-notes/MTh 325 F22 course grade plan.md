# MTH 325 Fall 2022 course grading 

| Grade | Daily Preps | Content Standards | Badges earned | 
| :----: | :-------:  | :---------------: | :------------: | 
|  A    |  (85% of max) | 18  | Both Proof and Applications | 
|  B    |  (75% of max) | 15 (16?)  | Either Proof or Applications | 
|  C    |  (65% of max) | 12 (14?)  | Either Proof or Applications | 
|  D    |  (35% of max) | 6   |  None required | 

- A grade of F is given if not all the requirements of a D are met. 
- Content standards for A, B, and C grades must include: P.1, P.2, G.1, G.2, and DR.1. Failure to meet all five results in a one letter grade deduction after all other tabulations are done. 
- Plus/minus grades: 
  - Plus: Given if you complete both, not just one of the badges OR if you meet the number of content standards for the next letter grade up. 
  - Minus: Given if you meet all the requirements for a grade except for Daily Prep. Grade adjustment in this case given at RTs discretion.
