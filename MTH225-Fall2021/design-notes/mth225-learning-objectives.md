  - State the negation of a quantified predicate.   
- Module 3: Sets and Functions
  - Determine whether a set is finite or infinite. 
  - Identify "famous" sets corresponding to their notation: The empty set, the natural numbers, the whole numbers, the integers, and the rational, real, and complex numbers. 
  - Given a set in roster form, rephrase the set in set-builder notation; and vice versa. 
  - Given a set in either roster or set-builder form and an object, determine whether the object is a member of the set.
  - State the definition of "subset" and given two sets, determine if one is a subset of the other. 
  - State the definition of "equality" of sets, and given two sets, determine if they are equal. 
  - Given a finite set, write its power set. 
  - Given a finite set, state its cardinality. 
  - Given two sets, find their intersection, union, difference, symmetric difference, and Cartesian product. 
  - Given a set and its universal set, find its complement. 
  - State the definition of a function between two sets. 
  - Given a mapping between two sets, determine whether or not it is a function. If it is, state the domain, range, and codomain. 
  - State the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions. 
  - Given a function between two sets, determine whether it is injective, surjective, or bijective. 
  - Compute outputs using the floor, ceiling, factorial, `DIV`, and `MOD` functions.  
- Module 4: Combinatorics

  - State the closed formula for the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ 
  - Compute values of the binomial coefficient using recursion, Pascal's Triangle, and the closed formula. 
  - Count the number of permutations of a group of objects and the number of $k$-permutations from a set of $n$ objects. 
  - Use the "stars and bars" method to count the number of ways to distribute objects among a group. 
  - State the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion and use it to count complex arrangements. 
  - Given a counting problem, identify which method is most appropriate which are not appropriate. 
- Module 5: Sequences, Recursion, and Induction
  - Compute values in a sequence defined as a closed formula. 
  - Compute values in a sequence defined as a recurrence relation. 
  - Given a finite sum, rewrite it using sigma notation; given sigma notation, calculate the sum.
