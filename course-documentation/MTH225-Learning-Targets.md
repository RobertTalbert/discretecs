# MTH 225 Learning Targets 

Mastery of Learning Targets in groups A, L, SF, C, SR, and P are assessed using Checkpoints and the alternatives to Checkpoints described earlier. Learning Targets in group CS are *not* assessed by Checkpoints but rather by a portfolio as part of the Final Exam. 

## Group A: Represent integers using different number bases, and perform integer arithmetic using different bases and modular arithmetic.  
  + A.1: I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16. 
  + A.2 **(Core)**: I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers written in binary. 
  + A.3: I can compute `a % b` given integers `a` and `b` and perform arithmetic mod $n$.  

## Group L: Formulate, manipulate, and determine the truth of logical expressions using symbolic logic.
  + L.1: I can use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language. 
  + L.2 **(Core)**: I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions. 
  + L.3: I can determine whether a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined, and state its negation. 
  + L.4 **(Core)**: I can write the truth table for a logical statement.
  + L.5: I can determine if a statement is a tautology and whether two statements are logically equivalent. 

## Group SF: Formulate and solve computational problems using sets and functions. 
  + SF.1 **(Core)**: I can represent a set in roster notation and set-builder notation; determine if an object is an element of a set; and determine set relationships (equality, subset). 
  + SF.2: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set. 
  + SF.3 **(Core)**: I can determine whether or not a given relation is a function, determine the domain and codomain of a function, and find the image and preimage of a point using a function. 
  + SF.4: I can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or bijective. 

## Group C: Formulate and solve complex counting problems using computational thinking and the tools of combinatorics. 
  + C.1 **(Core)**: I can use the additive and multiplicative principles and the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to formulate and solve counting problems. 
  + C.2: I can calculate a binomial coefficient and correctly apply the binomial coefficient to formulate and solve counting problems. 
  + C.3 **(Core)**: I can compute combinations and permutations and apply these to formulate and solve counting problems. 
  + C.4: I can use the "Stars and Bars" technique to formulate and solve counting problems. 

## Group SR: Evaluate numerical and other sequences using recursion, and solve simple recurrence relations. 
  + SR.1 **(Core)**: I can generate several values in a sequence defined using a closed-form expression or using recursion. 
  + SR.2: I can use sigma notation to rewrite a sum and determine the sum of an expression given in sigma notation. 
  + SR.3 **(Core)**: I can find closed-form and recursive expressions for arithmetic and geometric sequences and find their sums. 
  + SR.4: I can use iteration and characteristic roots to solve a recurrence relation. 

## Group P: Write clear, correct, and convincing arguments to explain the correctness of a solution using combinatorial proof and mathematical induction.
  + P.1: I can analyze and write a combinatorial proof of a combinatorial identity. 
  + P.2 **(Core)**: Given a statement to be proven by (weak) induction, I can state and prove the base case, state the inductive hypothesis, and outline the proof. 

## Group CS: Demonstrate problem solving, communication,and learning skills appropriate for computer science. 
  + CS.1: I can explain the reasoning behind solutions to computational problems clearly to an appropriate audience. 
  + CS.2: I can apply computer programming and computational thinking to frame and solve mathematical and computational problems. 
  + CS.3: I can self-assess my work and apply feedback from others to make improvements in my work.
