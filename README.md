Materials for Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science
==========

This is a repository of materials for Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science 1--2 at Grand Valley State University. Currently under construction is the second semester of this sequence, designated MTH 325. Distinguishing features of this course include: 

+ The use of the [Sage computer algebra system](http://sagemath.org) and [SageMath Cloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com) computing platform. 
+ An [inverted classroom design](http://invertedclassroom.wikispaces.com) in which students encounter basic concepts prior to class in order to have extended class time for creative application and conceptual work. 
+ The use of [specifications grading](http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=30598) to provide a competency-based means of assessing student work. 
+ An extended application project in which students work in teams to solve a problem or provide a service using the concepts of the course. 

Materials will be added in for MTH 325 and its prerequisite, MTH 225, as they are created. 

The professor of record for the course is Robert Talbert. Please contact on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert), [Google+](http://google.com/+RobertTalbert), or email at talbertr@gvsu.edu.
