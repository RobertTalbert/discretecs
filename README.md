This repository contains course materials for MTH 325, Discrete Structures for Computer Science 2, at Grand Valley State University. The course is an overview of recursion and induction, relations, graphs, and trees. 

This course is currently (Winter 2016) being taught and so more stuff will be added as the semester progresses. 

Contained in this repository are: 

+ Lesson notes -- Containing text for reading, video and other tutorial items, Preview Activities for students to do prior to class, and Daily Homework for class discussion. 
+ Miniprojects -- Small projects to extend the basic work done on Daily Homework. 

In the summer of 2016, materials for MTH 225 (Discrete Structures 1) will be added. That course covers sets, integer arithmetic, logic, counting, and proof. 

The professor of record for MTH 325 is Robert Talbert, whose website is at [http://rtalbert.org](http://rtalbert.org). Follow on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert).
