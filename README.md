# Discrete Structures for Computer Science 

This repository contains course materials for MTH 225: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1 and MTH 325: Discrete Structures for Computer Science 2, at Grand Valley State University. This is a two-semester course sequence required for all computer science majors. The rough breakdown of coures content is: 

+ MTH 225: Sets, functions, counting, sequences, mathematical induction, logic, and proof techniques. 
+ MTH 325: Graphs, graph applications, relations, and trees. 

Both courses are organized on the principle of [computational thinking](https://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/CurrFiles/CompThinkingFlyer.pdf) and employ Python programming, on the [Jupyter notebook platform](http://jupyter.org/), to explore concepts. Work with graph theory in MTH 325 uses the [networkX](https://networkx.github.io/) library. 

The textbook for the course is _Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction_ by Oscar Levin. The text is a free interactive e-book found [here](http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com/dmoi/). Downloadable versions are found [here](http://discretetext.oscarlevin.com/download.php). 

There is a folder for each class. Contained in each folder are subfolders for: 

+ __Course documentation__: Includes the course syllabus and other core documentation for students. 
+ __Assignments__: Homework sets, programming assignments, quizzes, and other graded work. 
+ __Lesson plans__: In situations where homemade notes are used in addition to or instead of the Levin book, those are housed here as Jupyter notebooks. 

There is also an Archive folder for materials from the older versions of MTH 225 and MTH 325. These materials are only loosely organized. 

The professor of record for MTH 325 is Robert Talbert, whose website is at [http://rtalbert.org](http://rtalbert.org). Follow on Twitter at [@RobertTalbert](http://twitter.com/RobertTalbert).
