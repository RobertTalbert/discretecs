# Overview 

This repository contains materials for MTH 225 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1) and MTH 325 (Discrete Structures for Computer Science 2) at [Grand Valley State University](http://gvsu.edu). These materials were created and are maintained by me, [Robert Talbert](http://rtalbert.org).

## How things are organized

There are two different courses housed in this repo, MTH 225 and MTH 325. While there are a lot of similarities between different instances of the same course, they're different enough to warrant keeping them in separate directories. These are labeled with the **course name** followed by a hyphen followed by the **semester**. For example, my MTH 325 class coming up in Fall 2022 is in `MTH 325-Fall2022`. 

Then, within each course you will find subdirectories for different materials. If you are specifically looking for syllabi, them those are usually in a directory called `course-documentation`. 

There are some archival directories at the top level: 

- `video` is contains the scripts and captions, for the instructional videos I made for this course. [Those videos are located here.](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8667148). 
- `archive` contains instances of the course prior to Fall 2021.
