Materials for Discrete Structures for Computer Science
=======================================================

This is a repository of materials for Discrete Structures for Computer Science 1--2 at Grand Valley State University. 

+ MTH 225 (Discrete Structures for CS 1) is an introduction to _sets_, _counting_, logic, proof, and probability for computer science. 
+ MTH 325 (Discrete Structures for CS 2) is an introduction to _relations_, _functions_, _recursion_, _graphs_, and _trees_ for computer science. 

Distinguishing features of this course include: 

+ The use of programming including Python via [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and the [Sage computer algebra system](http://sagemath.org), implemented using [SageMath Cloud](http://cloud.sagemath.com) . 
+ An [inverted classroom design](http://invertedclassroom.wikispaces.com) in which students encounter basic concepts prior to class in order to have extended class time for creative application and conceptual work. 
+ The use of [specifications grading](http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=30598) to provide a competency-based means of assessing student work. 
+ An extended application project in which students work in teams to solve a problem or provide a service using the concepts of the course. 


The professor of record for the course is Robert Talbert. More information about my professional work can be found at my website: http://rtalbert.org.
