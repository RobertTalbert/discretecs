# Daily Prep 2.1 -- MTH 225

## Overview
hello
This lesson transitions us into the next course module, on **Logic**. Logic is important in life, and it's the basis for how computers operate. We'll begin here with the basics: what *logical propositions* are, how to use *connectives* to form complex propositions out of simple ones, and the ins and outs of the all-important *conditional statement*. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

- Differentiate between a proposition and a statement that isn't a proposition. 
- Write the truth tables for `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`.
- Identify the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement. 
- State the conditions under which a conditional statement is true. 
- State the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement. 


**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

- Given a conditional statement composed of multiple conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations, and the truth values of the atomic statements, determine whether the statement is true or false. 
- Given a conditional statement and the truth values of its hypothesis and conclusion, state whether the conditional statement is true or false.

**Text:**  **This is the first lesson that uses our textbook!** It's available for free online, and cheap in print; links to both formats are found in the syllabus. **For this lesson, please read [Section 0.2](http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-statements.html) up to and including Example 0.2.6, but no farther.** Note there is some material in the book not found in the videos (for example "biconditional statements"). We will work with that in the class meeting. 

You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.

## Exercises 

Once you have watched the videos above and read the text, go to this form and complete all the non-optional items on it:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSee4hCuxB77ozgo1Lb2yWgeQUEsmi8W1-skASpLFWt5HtGSyw/viewform


## Submission and grading 

**Submitting your work:** Your work is submitted when you submit the Google Form. You should receive an email receipt indicating that the work was submitted successfully. 

**How this is graded:** The pre-class portion of the Daily Prep is graded either 0 points or 1 point, on the basis of completeness and effort. Wrong answers are not penalized. Earning a "1" requires that you: 

- Turn the work in before its deadline; 
- Leave no item blank or skipped, even accidentally; and 
- Give a good-faith effort at a correct answer on every non-optional item. 

More information can be found in the [Specifications for Satisfactory Work in MTH 225](/Cy6P0rGZQzuOM3NwZ3ZuMw) document. 

When you arrive for the class meeting, you'll be put into a group of 2-3 to complete a quiz over this material, which will be graded on a 0/1 scale on the basis of correctness.
