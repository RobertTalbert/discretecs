# Daily Prep 1.3 -- MTH 225

## Overview

We've learned how to add and subtract in binary --- now it's time to learn how to multiply and divide. Multiplication requires thinking about how to add more than two binary strings at the same time. Division requires remembering how to do long division and then adapting the process to base 2. 

## Learning objectives 

**Basic Learning Objectives:** *Before* our class meeting, use the Resources listed below to learn all of the following. You should be reasonably fluent with all of these tasks prior to our meeting; we will field questions on these, but they will not be retaught. 

+ Multiply two small (size 4 bits or less) integers in base 2. 
+ Perform long division on two *base 10* integers as a review from grade school. 
+ Perform long division on two small (size 4 bits or less) integers in base 2. 



**Advanced Learning Objectives:** *During and after* our class meeting, we will work on learning the following. Fluency with these is not required prior to class. 

+ Multiply two integers in base 2 of size greater than 4 bits.
+ Divide two integers in base 2 of size greater than 4 bits.

You are free to search for and use other resources in addition to, or instead of the above, as long as you can work the exercises below.

## Exercises 



Once you have watched the videos above, go to this form and complete all the non-optional items on it:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfbSNCbDcj0cA4mVIq6KyRiAJB_3QA3FgSyI_sG3cJxIijX_Q/viewform

**Please note, there are special instructions for part of this assignment, using the Padlet tool. Make sure to read those carefully.**



There are optional items at the end you can use to send questions or comments.


## Submission and grading 

**Submitting your work:** Your work is submitted when you submit the Google Form and your work on the multiplication and division problems is posted to Padlet. You should receive an email receipt indicating that the Google Form was submitted successfully.  

**How this is graded:** The pre-class portion of the Daily Prep is graded either 0 points or 1 point, on the basis of completeness and effort. Wrong answers are not penalized. Earning a "1" requires that you: 

- Turn the work in before its deadline; 
- Leave no item blank or skipped, even accidentally; and 
- Give a good-faith effort at a correct answer on every non-optional item. 

More information can be found in the [Specifications for Satisfactory Work in MTH 225](/Cy6P0rGZQzuOM3NwZ3ZuMw) document. 

When you arrive for the class meeting, you'll be put into a group of 2-3 to complete a quiz over this material, which will be graded on a 0/1 scale on the basis of correctness.
