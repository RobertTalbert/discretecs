For each of the following, determine whether the function is injective, then determine if it is surjective, then determine if it is bijective. If the function FAILS to have a property, give a specific example that demonstrates this. 

f: N --> N given by f(n) = n + 1
g: {0,1,2,3} --> {1,2,4,8} given by g(n) = 2**n (2 to the nth power) 
h: Z --> N given by h(n) = n**2 (n squared)
