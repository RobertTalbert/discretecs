# Checkpoint information

## Draft schedule of Checkpoints 

## Checkpoint Tasks and Grading rubrics for each Learning Target

+ A.1: I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16.

+ A.2 **(Core)**: I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two integers written in binary.

+ A.3: I can compute `a % b` given integers `a` and `b` and perform arithmetic mod $n$.
+ L.1: I can use propositional variables and logical connectives to represent statements; and interpret symbolic logical statements in plain language.

+ L.2 **(Core)**: I can write the negation, converse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement and use DeMorgan's Laws to simplify symbolic logical expressions.

+ L.3: I can determine whether a quantified statement is true, false, or underdetermined, and state its negation.

+ L.4 **(Core)**: I can write the truth table for a logical statement.

+ L.5: I can determine if a statement is a tautology and whether two statements are logically equivalent.
+ SF.1 **(Core)**: I can represent a set in roster notation and set-builder notation; determine if an object is an element of a set; and determine set relationships (equality, subset).

+ SF.2: I can perform operations on sets (intersection, union, complement, Cartesian product) and determine the cardinality of a set.

+ SF.3 **(Core)**: I can determine whether or not a given relation is a function, determine the domain and codomain of a function, and find the image and preimage of a point using a function.

+ SF.4: I can determine whether a function is injective, surjective, or bijective.
+ C.1 **(Core)**: I can use the additive and multiplicative principles and the Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion to formulate and solve counting problems.

+ C.2: I can calculate a binomial coefficient and correctly apply the binomial coefficient to formulate and solve counting problems.

+ C.3 **(Core)**: I can compute combinations and permutations and apply these to formulate and solve counting problems.

+ C.4: I can use the "Stars and Bars" technique to formulate and solve counting problems.
