# AEP 7: Polynomial fitting of sequences

## Overview 

In this AEP, you'll learn about another way to find a closed formula for an integer sequence using curve-fitting with polynomials. 

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

-   **SR.3**  **(Core)**: I can find closed-form and recursive expressions for arithmetic and geometric sequences and find their sums.

Remember, AEPs do not have fixed deadlines; simply work on this item until you are ready to submit it. But remember the **Two Items Per Week Rule.** 

## Technology Background

This AEP has a programming option, and you'll need to have the basic set of Python skills from the Code Academy course to do that. 

## AEP Description and Tasks 

### What this AEP is about
 



### Tasks for this AEP

1. Find all of the following values and show your reasoning. If a value doesn't exist, say so (no explanation needed, but make sure you are correct!). 

   a) $5^{-1} \ \% \ 17$
   b) $13^{-1} \ \% \ 22$
   c) $11^{-1} \ \% \ 22$
   d) $21^{-1} \ \% \ 26$
   e) $4^{-1} \ \% \ 26$
   f) $17^{-1} \ \% \ 50$
   g) $8^{-1} \ \% \ 50$

2. Look at your data from the first question and any additional data you might generate through additional examples, and look at the values of $a$ and $n$ when $a^{-1} \ \% \ n$ exists. What is the value of $\gcd(a,n)$ in those situations? Use your observation to fill in the blank with a conjecture: 
 
**If $a,n$ are integers, then $a^{-1} \ \% \ n$ exists  if $\gcd(a,n)$ ____________.**

Now let's think about how we might find $a^{-1} \ \% \ n$ more efficiently than with a brute-force search. 

4. Let $a = 92$ and $n = 777$. Use the Euclidean Algorithm to show that $\gcd(a,n) = 1$, and then use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $92x + 777y = 1$. Be sure to show all your work here. 
5. Take the $x$ you found in the previous problem and let $x' = x \ \% \ 777$. Show (similarly to how you did this in the first problem) that $x' = 92^{-1} \ \% \ 777$. 
6. Repeat the idea from tasks 4 and 5 to calculate $1717^{-1} \ \% \ 202020$. 
7. Based on your previous items, write out an algorithm (in regular English, not in code) on how to calculate $a^{-1} \ \% \ n$ for any positive integers $a,n$. Include conditions under which this number will fail to exist and therefore the algorithm would immediately stop. 


8. Finally, we're going to connect this to give a hint to a solution for a problem on *another* AEP. Suppose $n, e$, and $d$ are positive integers and define $M = \frac{ed-1}{n}$. 

   a) Show that $ed + (-M)n = 1$. Make your reasoning clear. 
   b) Based on this fact, what can you conclude about the integers $e$ and $d$? Why? 
   c) How might the answer to part (b) give you a way to quickly and efficiently compute $d$ if you were given the values of $e$ and $n$? 

## Assignment Expectations and Grading Criteria 

>**Note: The wording on these expectations has changed in places. Please read carefully**. 

AEPs are graded using the "EMRN" rubric found in the syllabus. Please note, it is the case with all AEP's that **your grade is primarily based on your explanations and writing, and only secondarily on the precision and correctness of your computations.** Correct computations with insufficient explanation will need to be revised and may receive an "N" grade. 

Also, **significant incompleteness will result in a grade of "N".** This includes the following: 

- **Giving answers with no explanations.** As mentioned above, you are being graded on explanations and writing, not so much on answers. Submissions that contain items where there is an answer with no explanation or insufficient explanation, will be graded "N" and returned without comment.
- Leaving items blank (even accidentally)
- Leaving large gaps in computations (skipping important steps) 
- Giving only partial attempts at tasks (for example, working down to a certain point in a solution and then stopping because you need help) 



**A grade of E or M requires all of the following to be met:**

- All work needs to be shown *and* your thought processes clearly expressed in all of the tasks of the assignment. The results also need to be correct. 
- All the information needed for an "outsider" to understand your work needs to be self-contained within the work. **The reader should not have to do any work to fill in gaps.** 
- Explanations must be given in clearly written and grammatically correct English. Multiple instances of failure to capitalize beginnings of sentences, subject-verb agreement, misuse of punctuation, etc. will result in a grade of R or N. 
- Some simple mistakes in calculations are allowed, but significant errors and those that lead to incorrect explanations will probably result in a grade or R or N. 


There are some additional formatting requirements in the "Submitting your work" section below. 


A grade of "E" is given if all of the above expectations are met, and the work is of superior quality in terms of the clarity of explanations and work, appearance of the writeup, and precision of the mathematics. 



## Submitting your work 

**AEP submissions must be typewritten and saved as either a PDF or MS Word file. No part of your submission may involve handwriting; work that is submitted that contains handwriting will be graded N and returned without feedback.** This includes electronic handwritten documents, for example using a stylus and a note-taking app. To type up your work, you can use MS Word or Google Docs (both of which have equation editors for mathematical notation) or any other computer-based math typesetting tool. Just make sure you save your work as a Word document or PDF (no `.odt`, `.rtf`, or other file extensions are allowed).

When you have your work typed up, double-check it for neatness, correctness, and clarity. Then, go to Blackboard, then **Assignments**, then **AEP**, then **AEP 5**. Clicking on the text "AEP 5" will take you to a place on Blackboard where you can upload your work. All grading and revisions of labs are done entirely on Blackboard. **Do not email your work to the professor** -- only Blackboard submissions are accepted.

## Getting Help

Please note that according to the syllabus, for AEP's **"no interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed."** Violations of this rule include *any* consultation with other students or former students, including Math Center tutors; using work from another student or former student; submitting the problem set to an online help site such as Chegg or Coursehero; or asking for help in an online forum. All such violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will result in a grade of "N" and being banned from revising the work. 

You **may** ask me (Talbert) for help on this assignment in the form of **specific mathematical or technical questions**. If I cannot answer a question because it would give too much away, I'll tell you so. **However please note: I will not "look over your work" before you submit it to give you feedback on the overall submission**; the expectations are clearly laid out above, so just follow those directions and submit your best work, and you'll be allowed to revise it if needed. 
 
**You can ask technology related questions to anyone at any time**. For example if you need help with Desmos, or with figuring out how to type up your work, there are no restrictions on that. I recommend the `#tech` channel on Campuswire so that you'll reach a large audience.
