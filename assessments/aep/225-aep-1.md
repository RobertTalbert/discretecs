# AEP 1: Encrypting messages with binary 

## Overview 

In this AEP, you will learn about a way of **encrypting** a message --- encoding it so that only the sender and the intended recipient can read it --- that uses base 2 representations of integers and a special operation on binary integers known as **XOR**. 

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

+ **A.1:** I can represent an integer in base 2, 8, 10, and 16.

Remember, AEPs do not have fixed deadlines; simply work on this item until you are ready to submit it. But remember the **Two Items Per Week Rule.** 

## Technology Background

Some of the tasks in this AEP can be done by programming in Python. If you opt to do the programming tasks, you'll need to have completed the **Python/Jupyter Crash Course** that was assigned during the first week of classes. If you do not opt to do those tasks, there's no special tech background needed. 

## AEP Description and Tasks 

### What this AEP is about

We keep secrets from each other all the time. Those secrets aren't necessarily incriminating or bad; for example, our credit card numbers, social security numbers, and browsing histories are all information that we'd rather not have leaked into the public eye. To keep that information secret in a digital form, we use **encryption**. Encryption refers to any process that transforms information into a format that is readable only to the owner of that information and the people or machines who the owner decides should see it. When encrypted information is sent, the recipient turns it back into a readable format by **decrypting** it. Both encryption and decryption use a **key**, which is a piece of information (a number, a code phrase, etc.) that, like a physical key, is used to lock and unlock the information being sent. 

This AEP is about a method of encryption and decryption that at one time was very common in the early days of digital communications, and which (unfortunately, as you'll see) is still used in some places today. It involves transforming human-readable messages into binary integers, then using a binary string as a key to encrypt it, via a special binary operation called **XOR**. In this AEP you'll learn how to encrypt and decrypt using this **XOR cipher**, and play the role of an adversary by breaking an intercepted message encrypted using the XOR cipher. 

### Setup (do this first) 

Here's a description of how the XOR cipher works. 

First, the cipher involves the **XOR** operation. This is an arithmetic operation on single bits (0's and 1's) that works as follows:

## Assignment Expectations and Grading Criteria 

AEPs are graded using the "EMRN" rubric found in the syllabus. **A grade of E or M requires all of the following to be met:**


- In task 3:
	- **All parts of task 3 must consist not only of correct, complete computations but also clear, correct English text that explains to the reader what is taking place.** Responses that are just raw calculations with no text will receive a "N" (Not Assessible) grade. Responses that have significant issues with the clarity or correctness of the explanatory text may receive a grade of R ("Needs Revision").
	- The computations in parts (a) and (b) are correct and the work is shown (in addition to the explanatory text).
	- The computation in part (c) is correct, and the numerical process involves at least 4-5 computations from the left and the same amount from the right. (For comparison, the first limit that is computed in Example 1.2.4(a) in the textbook, which is shown in Tables 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, uses eight computations each.)
- All work is shown, and all results are explained clearly. 

Please note, it is the case with all AEP's that **your grade is primarily based on your explanations and writing, and only secondarily on the precision and correctness of your computations.** Correct computations with insufficient explanation will need to be revised and may receive an "N" grade. 

A grade of "E" is given if all of the above expectations are met, and the work is of superior quality in terms of the clarity of explanations and work, appearance of the writeup, and precision of the mathematics. 


## Submitting your work 

**AEP submissions must be typewritten and saved as either a PDF or MS Word file. No part of your submission may involve handwriting; work that is submitted that contains handwriting will be graded N and returned without feedback.** This includes electronic handwritten docments, for example using a stylus and a note-taking app. To type up your work, you can use MS Word or Google Docs (both of which have equation editors for mathematical notation) or any other computer-based math typesetting tool. Just make sure you save your work as a Word document or PDF (no `.odt`, `.rtf`, or other file extensions are allowed).

When you have your work typed up, double-check it for neatness, correctness, and clarity. Then, go to Blackboard, then **Assignments**, then **AEP**, then **AEP ???**. Clicking on the text "AEP ???" will take you to a place on Blackboard where you can upload your work. All grading and revisions of labs are done entirely on Blackboard. **Do not email your work to the professor** -- only Blackboard submissions are accepted.

## Getting Help

Please note that according to the syllabus, for AEP's **"no interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed."** Violations of this rule include *any* consultation with other students or former students, including Math Center tutors; using work from another student or former student; submitting the problem set to an online help site such as Chegg or Coursehero; or asking for help in an online forum. All such violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will result in a grade of "N" and being banned from revising the work. 

You **may** ask me (Talbert) for help on this assignment in the form of **specific mathematical or technical questions**. If I cannot answer a question because it would give too much away, I'll tell you so. **However please note: I will not "look over your work" before you submit it to give you feedback on the overall submission**; the expectations are clearly laid out above, so just follow those directions and submit your best work, and you'll be allowed to revise it if needed. 
 
**You can ask technology related questions to anyone at any time**. For example if you need help with Desmos, or with figuring out how to type up your work, there are no restrictions on that. I recommend the `#tech` channel on Campuswire so that you'll reach a large audience.
