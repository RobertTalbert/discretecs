# AEP 2: Public-Key Encryption

## Overview 

In this AEP, you will apply the concepts of modular arithmetic, especially the repeated squaring algorithm to compute powers modulo $n$, to learn about the powerful concept of **public key encryption** --- a method of encrypting and decrypting messages without sharing private information beforehand. The successful implementation of public-key encryption in the 1980's is widely considered one of the greatest scientific innovations of the last few centuries, and we use it every day without realizing it. And it all boils down to arithmetic! 

**Learning Targets associated with this AEP:**

-   A.3: I can compute  `a % b`  given integers  `a`  and  `b`  and perform arithmetic mod $n$.

Remember, AEPs do not have fixed deadlines; simply work on this item until you are ready to submit it. But remember the **Two Items Per Week Rule.** 

## Technology Background

Some of the tasks in this AEP can be done by programming in Python. If you opt to do the programming tasks, you'll need to have completed the **Python/Jupyter Crash Course** that was assigned during the first week of classes. If you do not opt to do those tasks, there's no special tech background needed. 

## AEP Description and Tasks 

### What this AEP is about

This AEP focuses on another method for **encrypting** and **decrypting** messages that has a fundamental difference from the other methods we've seen in class and in AEP 1. Before going any farther, please read the "What this AEP is about" section for AEP 1 for an overview of basic terminology and concepts from cryptography such as *encryption*, *decryption*, and *key*.

In all the other cryptosystems we have seen in the course (shift cipher, multiplicative cipher, the XOR cipher in AEP 1), *Alice* is trying to send a message to *Bob*, but she doesn't want an evil eavesdropper *Eve* to be able to read it, even if the message is intercepted. So Alice encrypts the message and sends it to Bob. Simple, right? But there's one problem: In all of those earlier systems, **Alice and Bob have to share the key**. It's a lot like if I wanted to grant you access to my office --- I'd need to somehow get you my physical key. But what if...

- ...Sharing the key for encryption and decryption was problematic? For example, what I believed that "Eve" might be eavesdropping on the channel I am using to send you the key? I could encrypt the key, but that doesn't solve the problem, because how will I get you the *second* key that encrypts the first one, in a way that convinces me Eve hasn't stolen it or tampered with it? The [Diffie-Hellman protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange) we studied in Module 2 addresses this problem, but it doesn't solve the next one:
- ...I wanted to send you a message but also wanted to remain anonymous --- like a whistleblower who wants to send an encrypted message to a reporter? Traditional cryptosystems fail on this front because they require that I reveal my identity to you in order to send the message.

### Tasks for this AEP



## Assignment Expectations and Grading Criteria 

AEPs are graded using the "EMRN" rubric found in the syllabus. **A grade of E or M requires all of the following to be met:**


- In task 3:
	- **All parts of task 3 must consist not only of correct, complete computations but also clear, correct English text that explains to the reader what is taking place.** Responses that are just raw calculations with no text will receive a "N" (Not Assessible) grade. Responses that have significant issues with the clarity or correctness of the explanatory text may receive a grade of R ("Needs Revision").
	- The computations in parts (a) and (b) are correct and the work is shown (in addition to the explanatory text).
	- The computation in part (c) is correct, and the numerical process involves at least 4-5 computations from the left and the same amount from the right. (For comparison, the first limit that is computed in Example 1.2.4(a) in the textbook, which is shown in Tables 1.2.5 and 1.2.6, uses eight computations each.)
- All work is shown, and all results are explained clearly. 

Please note, it is the case with all AEP's that **your grade is primarily based on your explanations and writing, and only secondarily on the precision and correctness of your computations.** Correct computations with insufficient explanation will need to be revised and may receive an "N" grade. 

A grade of "E" is given if all of the above expectations are met, and the work is of superior quality in terms of the clarity of explanations and work, appearance of the writeup, and precision of the mathematics. 


## Submitting your work 

**AEP submissions must be typewritten and saved as either a PDF or MS Word file. No part of your submission may involve handwriting; work that is submitted that contains handwriting will be graded N and returned without feedback.** This includes electronic handwritten docments, for example using a stylus and a note-taking app. To type up your work, you can use MS Word or Google Docs (both of which have equation editors for mathematical notation) or any other computer-based math typesetting tool. Just make sure you save your work as a Word document or PDF (no `.odt`, `.rtf`, or other file extensions are allowed).

When you have your work typed up, double-check it for neatness, correctness, and clarity. Then, go to Blackboard, then **Assignments**, then **AEP**, then **AEP ???**. Clicking on the text "AEP ???" will take you to a place on Blackboard where you can upload your work. All grading and revisions of labs are done entirely on Blackboard. **Do not email your work to the professor** -- only Blackboard submissions are accepted.

## Getting Help

Please note that according to the syllabus, for AEP's **"no interactions at all with another person or with unauthorized sources on the internet is allowed."** Violations of this rule include *any* consultation with other students or former students, including Math Center tutors; using work from another student or former student; submitting the problem set to an online help site such as Chegg or Coursehero; or asking for help in an online forum. All such violations will be treated as academic dishonesty and will result in a grade of "N" and being banned from revising the work. 

You **may** ask me (Talbert) for help on this assignment in the form of **specific mathematical or technical questions**. If I cannot answer a question because it would give too much away, I'll tell you so. **However please note: I will not "look over your work" before you submit it to give you feedback on the overall submission**; the expectations are clearly laid out above, so just follow those directions and submit your best work, and you'll be allowed to revise it if needed. 
 
**You can ask technology related questions to anyone at any time**. For example if you need help with Desmos, or with figuring out how to type up your work, there are no restrictions on that. I recommend the `#tech` channel on Campuswire so that you'll reach a large audience.
