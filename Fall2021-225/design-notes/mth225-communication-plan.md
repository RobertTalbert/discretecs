# How will we communicate? 

- Early in the class, maybe at end of week 1: Questionnaire on how it's going, what do you need, etc. 
- Daily: Form at end of class for questions and comments 
- Biweekly: Check-in using the five-question summary + open ended questions; and post summaries 
- MIT for around week 7 or 8 
- Ongoing:
  - Office hours: Ask students early how they want this. In person or virtual? And when/how often? 
  - Discussion board or Slack 
  - Make up a guide on how to ask questions 
  - Weekly guides posted Friday afternoons 
  - Forms: Token requests, feedback/suggestions that's anonymous, grade discrepancies
