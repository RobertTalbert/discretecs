# MTH 225 general activity planning

- The course meets MWF for 50 minutes. 
- 10 + 30 + 10: 
  - 10 minutes of recap and Q&A
  - 30 minutes of activity on main topics/advanced objectives 
  - 10 minutes of wrapup/metacognition 


## Preclass activities

- The usual, video and text with exercises to complete
- But also: 
  - What did you already know about this topic that could guide your learning? 
  - What is the most confusing thing about this topic so far?

"1 point" for completing the pre-class on time, no gaps, no BS. 


## Ideas for activities in class

- First 10 
  - Polling
  - Quizzes 
  - Finish a blank copy of preclass 
  - "1 point" for satisfactory completion of the startup activity. So 2 "points" total. 
- Middle 30
  - Hands-on activities with sharing out 
  - Could be polling
  - Could be doing computations, truth tables, etc. 
  - Always involves presenting/explaining work and reasoning. 
  - **THERE IS NO LECTURING** unless it's a spot lecture -- **trust the preclass activities** 
- Final 10 
  - Polling to isolate main ideas
  - A single feedback form for questions, metacognition that we use every class  
    - What is the least clear point of this topic? *The most confusing thing about today's lesson was...*
    - What worked for you today? *Something that really helped me learn today was...* 
    - *Something I still need to learn is...*
