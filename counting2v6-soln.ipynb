    "_Question: Why isn't it $52 \\times 51 \\times 50 \\times 49 \\times 48$?_ It's because this product counts the number of ways that a selection of 5 objects from a group of 52 can be rearranged. It's as if you had a race with 52 competitors, and you wanted to know the number of ways to award first through fifth place. The same group of people arranged in a different order would be counted differently. But this is not the case with a hand of cards -- the order of the arrangement doesn't matter. For example a hand consisting of 4 of spades, 3 of clubs, 3 of diamonds, 10 of hearts, and ace of spades is the same had as 4 of spades, ace of spades, 3 of diamonds, 10 of hearts, and 3 of clubs. The product listed here would be exactly $5!$ times too large because it takes ordering into account when it shouldn't. \n",
